377160,Fallout 4,1/28/2016,False,"This game is very hard to review. It somehow manages to have an endless amount of things to do, while having absolutely nothing to do and being extremely bored because of it. It's impressive really. To make this simple I'll make a section of pros and cons and have a write up for each feature I like or dislike. 

[h1]PROS[/h1]
[b]Combat[/b]
The combat in Fallout 4 is smooth, fun, and interesting.  There are literally hundreds of ways to kill your enemies in any variety of fashions. Improvements on enemy AI make each enemy unique, from ghouls lunging at you, deathclaws bobbing and weaving around your bullets, or raiders riposting your melee attacks. The enemies are smarter. They also actually use cover now. VATS is still as good as ever. Reliable damage with a percentage chance to hit. You can also sprint now by using AP, a feature that was actually a New Vegas mod. Easily the best combat out of all of the Fallout games by far, ignoring 1&2 as it wouldn't be fair to compare the first games. 

[b]The World[/b]
The post apocalyptic Boston Commonwealth is a fantastic place to explore. Several famous landmarks are present, the historic feeling the city of Boston actually has is portayed well, and it's absolutely giant. There are a massive amount of things to find in the world. There are hundreds of marked locations and an uncountable amount of unmarked ones as well. If you enjoy aimlessly exploring, you'll love this game.

[b]Crafting Systems[/b]
This is by far my absolute favorite improvement Bethesda brought with Fallout 4. The new overhauled crafting system is spectacular. You can create any number of combinations for weapons, allowing you to build the perfect weapon for you. For example, let me talk about the combat rifle. You can turn the combat rifle into a bolt action sniper, or a full auto SBR, and anything inbetween. The mix-and-match system for upgrades is absolutely grand because it allows you to fine tune your weapons to be a perfect fit for your character and playstyle. You can also customize armor, although it's not as exciting. The most you can really do is upgrade your stats. You can also customize your power armor, but we'll touch on that later. The new crafting system also makes junk loot usefull. By scavenging random junk that would of been useless in previous Fallout games, you can scrap them for materials and parts to build other items. Find a cooking tray? Useless junk right? Nope. Melt that baby down and build a new reciever for your shotgun. The settlement building is also great. It's essentially Fallout: Minecraft edition, which is great by me. The only problem is it can start feeling a little game-y managing resources and such. It's fine overall though. It you like building like I do, this part is really, really cool.

[b]Power Armor[/b]
The power armor in this game is, if you'll excuse my language, fucking awesome. In previous Fallout titles, power armor was simply another regular set of armor that gave the best stats. Not in Fallout 4. Power armor is closer to a vehicle, like a mech suit, in Fallout 4. You climb into your power armor and instantly become an unkillable hulking beast powered by fusion cores. Oh yeah, power armor isn't powered by microfusion cells anymore. It's powered by fusion cores. Fusion cores are essentially nuclear batteries. You can find them scattered around the wasteland in random places. No fusion cores, no power armor. Don't worry though, you probably won't run out. The crafting system for power armor is equally awesome. You can fully customize your power armor with different upgrades ranging from a VATS computer inside the helmet, to electric fists, to a DAMN JETPACK! You can also paint your armors all different kinds of colors. If you have an idea of a cool suit, you can make it. Also, you can mix and match power armor pieces. Want X-01 arms, T-51b torso and helmet, and T-60 legs? Go for it, because you can, although having full X-01 will allways be more efficient, but harder to repair. 

[h1]CONS[/h1]
[b]Quests and Content[/b]
After finishing the main quest, which is decent at best, you have almost nothing to do. There are a few choice quests that stand out such as the USS constitution's quest or the Museum of Witchcraft, but apart from that the game is extremely lacking. A side effect of this is once you finish the main quest, there is no content left. The game becomes boring. You're left with the crafting system and settlement building. If that's enough to keep you occupied, you might be able to stretch Fallout 4 for a bit longer, but you'll eventually become bored. The game suffers heavily for having nothing to do, despite being one of the biggest open world games ever released. There are so many places to explore but nothing to actually DO. It's the Fallout equivalent of having a cake but not being able to eat it. There are a ton of cool places like the Combat Zone and the Robot Race Track where there could be interesting or unique interactions, but they're just more raider shooting galleries. You're probably only going to get ~80 hours out of the game if you're an average gamer, over 100 if you try and stretch it. By starting with a new character and siding with different factions OR if for some reason you're okay just aimlessly exploring, you could probably get ~150.

[b]Writing and Player Character[/b]
The writing in this game is just pretty bad. Apart from being clich√©, predictable, convoluted, and not really giving you an actual reason to care, it limits your roleplaying potential. In previous Fallout games, you were in complete control of your character's personality, traits, opinions, etc. In Fallout 4, you are a semi-goody two shoes no matter what you do. This is a side effect of both the voiced protagonist and the 4 dialog option. The game will direct your character on rails the entire game. The game lies to you by telling you you are free. Sure, you're free to go wherever, and do whatever you want, but you will complete quests the way Bethesda wants you to, or you won't complete them at all. In New Vegas, you could finish and complete quests in literally any way you want, and the game would be ready for it. Not in Fallout 4. You don't get to roleplay as the player character and make your own meaningful decisions. You're Bethesda's sole survivor and you will do as you are told. 

[b]Graphics[/b]
The game can be pretty, and it looks good. It's not graphically impressive like The Witcher 3, and it doesn't have a fantastic aesthetic like Bioshock Infinite. It looks alright and is graphically fine. It's just 'meh' across the board. That's okay. The problem arrives the game runs like garbage. I have a GTX 770, and I have to run this game on medium-high. That's a complete joke when I can count the pixels on the rust texture that they reused on every piece of metal in the game. The game is very poorly optimized. Games like Metro Last Light, which is much more graphically impressive, and has a much better aesthetic, I can run at high-ultra WITH higher frames than on Fallout 4. Ridiculous. 

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]6/10[/b]
Don't buy this game if you want a true roleplaying experience like Fallout 1, 2, and New vegas. It's a glorified open world shooter with a perk system. It would be a sham to call it an RPG, or anything close to it. It's closer to Borderlands than Fallout. If you want an open world shooter with a solid crafting system, and you don't mind not having much content after the main story, then get this game. You'll enjoy it. If you're like me and wanted an inclusive Fallout open world RPG that was in depth and full of rich story telling and interesting characters, don't buy it. You'll only be longing for what this game could of been. Just play New Vegas with some mods. In my opinion, New Vegas is the best game in the series. Let's hope Obsidian makes another Fallout game, and takes from what Fallout 4 improved on, and makes a a great RPG.",90113,1909,76561198121817700,6,70.48 hrs

262060,Darkest Dungeon¬Æ,12/1/2015,False,"I've had Darkest Dungeon for a while now and I'm pretty upset with the direction the developers have taken with it.  DD has always been a somewhat difficult game that can be really cruel with RNG, especially as you frist start out.  Many people say that there is no ""fail state"", but you feel like a failure when you lose about 10-20 hours of progress per character you lose.  There have been ways to be careful, risky, and successful while mitigating the risk of horrible RNG; however, the developers have taken it upon themselves to not only patch out the clever ways you can make your characters not die, but also introduce new facets that screw you over more.

The reason I don't recommend this game is because I feel like the developers are heavy-handed with their patch fixes based on how players are deciding to play their game, rather than actually fixing the bugs and features that aren't working properly.  Several trinkets simply don't work, several skills don't work as intended (looking at you, Man at Arms with Guard, thanks for getting my Arbalest one shot), several of the buffs and debuffs don't work as intended, and now the enemies and dungeons are for the most part broken.  Since the patch, I've had to retreat from all 5 dungeons because of the new enemies, the limitations on items you can bring (for instance, there were 2 wall curios in the first 3 hallways in the Cove, and since I was on a scouting mission I ran out of shovels and couldn't complete the dungeon without clawing through the other 5 wall curious I saw).

In short, the game has always been hard.  The game has always been out to get you, and set you back on time you've spent playing it (by getting your hard-earned heroes killed with crits).  Just like the intro says, DD is about making the best out of difficult situations.  The game in its current state, and with the way the developers have been taking it, is pure masochism.   I'm not sure if the developers playtest their game, because if I were them I sure as hell wouldn't want to.

If you've made it through this wall of text to this far, please excuse me if I seem like I'm bitching.  I actually like rogue-likes, and I'm familiar with the concept of being set back in time and losing things permanently.  Nobody likes being treated unfairly, and it feels like the game is a chore.  If the idea was to make it stressful, it's just annoying.  On the plus side, the developers ARE active and DO create new content frequently, but on the negative side a lot of the ideas they take from the community are pretty stupid.

All in all, if you're thinking of purchasing this game, it might be a good idea to wait until it's finished.

Edit for clarity:

After seeing the positive reviews that mostly knock players for not understanding the mechanics, I figured I'd approach those mechanics from a different angle than the positive reviews, since I do understand the mechanics.

The trinkets:
I feel like they simply aren't balanced.  Most of the ""Ancestral"" (legendary trinkets) hurt more than they help.  For instance, one gives 5% increased crit to melee, but adds 5% stress damage to your characters.  That character will be targeted by stress attacks by the AI if he has the lowest stress resist and is in a position to be targeted, and you will be dished out more stress damage by the two to three enemies that deal stress damage than you will ever be able to recoup with your one turn and 5% increased crit.  On the plus side, at least this trinket works as intended.

The increased prices:
Most people aren't complaining about the increased prices because it makes the game ""harder"", it just makes the grind longer and makes it more of a pain in the ass.  Also, the sting of defeat hits a lot harder and your start is a lot rougher.  Has this specific issue bugged me?  No, not really.

Curios:
Honestly, they're not that big of a deal except for the item limitation imposed now.  When you have a bank, you want to overprepare - now you can't.  You can always just ignore curios and get rid of quirks that force you to interact with curios.

Healing:
The devs don't want you to faceroll everything with damage stacking, but they also don't want you to be able to heal your heroes against lone targets.  So they add stun resistance to monsters for multiple stuns, then they add stress damage, then they add increased stress damage for stalling, then they add monster reinforcements.  Has this ever affected me personally?  No, because for the most part I manage my heals pretty well and bring balanced parties that are tailored to specific dungeons.  Do I find it stupid that the developers are punishing people who ALREADY take a tedious and careful approach, gut it, and make the game even MORE tedious and punishing?  Yeah, but for for the most part this facet also hasn't really affected me.

Facerolling:
Do you have Legendary heroes with max equipment and skills?  Did they ever completely faceroll everything?  Or do you still get your Occultist eldritch pulled into a treebrance smackdown from a giant?  Yeah, same here.  The game has never been ""too easy"" or ""too hard"", but as your heroes leveled and upgraded your start to reduce the variance which leads to a catastrophic collapse of your party.  One bad move, one bad stress hit crit, one bad bleed stack, one bad smackdown crit could all lead to damage you cannot recoup in A SINGLE BATTLE.  The recent patches have made even non-room battles more deadly.

Class choices:
Let's face it, some classes are just underpowered.  I use the Grave Robber just because she's one of my favorites, and she's a great support unit.  Depending on where you are, you can remove blight and bleed, make her a dodge tank, or turn her into a crit monster.  The Jester and the Man at Arms are both great units to use in conjunction with her, but her low health has always made her vulnerable.  Guarantee she's going to hit death's door at least once, maybe three or four times if you're taking her to a boss battle.  I use her not always because she's the optimal choice, but I like the concept.  With the new patch, I pretty much only want to use Bounty Hunter for my scouter.  The Houndmaster is pretty cool, but again he's pretty underpowered as well.  Weak 1-2 damage AOE hits with bleed only serve well against maybe one fight, and that's the formless flesh.  In other words, there's cases where heroes have a skill that is useful in only ONE portion of the game - also looking at you, Man at Arms skill Guard - which doesn't always work by the way, especially against the Prophet.  In a game where the developers nerf heroes that are being used to ""faceroll"" things and do large amounts of damage, the other heroes which are underpowered and suboptimal in pretty much every dungeon are left untouched.  If anything, it shows a lack of focus and forward thinking on the developers part - flaws that will be fatal to you as the player in a dungeon, but compeltely acceptable for the game's creators...

For the most part, I tend to leave the game specific gripes out because people thinking about buying the game... haven't played it.  But for those of you complainig about the negative reviews and saying ""those who reveiew negatively just need to git gud and stop QQing"", there are legimate reasons why people don't like DD.  I've loved this game since the beginning, but l don't like the direction the developers are taking it.

If you enjoy the game as it is, please direct your butthurt elsewhere.  By the way, nice job posting my review at the top of /r/DarkestDungeon and vote brigading the thumbs downs, Reddit.",33027,1290,76561197980429200,33,69.82 hrs
588650,Dead Cells,6/9/2017,True,"Dead Cells is a game that I would describe as a mix of Castlevania, Dark Souls and most of the rogue-lites out there. You take control over a ninja-like character and your goal is to get through a bunch of randomly generated levels and defeat evil (I suppose, I'm yet to finish the game myself :P and keep in mind that it's the EARLY ACCESS game and that there's like a year of development to come which will fill story gaps and bring a ton of new items and mechanics)

Now this game is a masterpiece in my opinion, and here's why:

1) levels - randomly generated levels make the adventure fresh every time you play. Not only that, but there are alternate paths to be taken (pretty cleverly locked behind certain 'skillchecks') and you're not destined to commit to one of them! It's this 'interweave' sort of a deal, where you can go hard path for one level and then hop back to normal path in the next. To put it more simply - in each level you have pretty much 3 entrances to the next level, it's entirely up to you which one you'll choose. And it's not only one enviroment. You fight in the castle, sewers, harbor-esk town, graveyard... And every level is different. In one you go up, in other you drop down, others are just flat, long distances to traverse. Everything designed to be easy to traverse but difficult to leave unscathed

2) weapons/skills - you start the run with 2 weapons - sword and bow/shield. You can find random gear during the run of course and what's cool is that there's never a 'right' answer to what to use. You have to be flexible and think about your loadout, because one random weapon/skill drop can flip your playstyle inside out. And I like that weapons have weight attached to them. for example, when you swing the big, massive sword or hammer, it has a significant delay in attack (but much better damage of course). There's tons of other weapons with different quirks. Some inflict bleed/poison, some crit while backstabbing, some crit when enemy is near the wall, some get bonus damage against frozen targets, etc - the variety is stunning

skills - 2 slots, things to crowd control / augment your weapons. Magnetic grenades to keep enemies in place, meat grinders to bleed them, turrets, bear traps, etc, all with additional benefits / synergies. Again, stunning variety already

3) movement - this has to be one of the most precise and enjoyable to traverse games available. Super tight controls (at least with x360 pad), dash move, double jump - full control! You even have dropjump which can hurt the enemies, but it's one of those moves that you love videogames for, because it's just fun to use randomly :) You know what I'm saying? :P Sometimes you just jump around to use it, it's so fun :)

4) builds - there's no 'right' build in this game. You can upgrade strenght and go full sword damage, you can upgrade health and create regen build, you can make skills only build, you can do something stupid like whip that brings enemies closer to you and then your secondary kick that pushes them away :) Again, everything depends on the stuff that you find on the way. Adapt or die, that's the name of the game :P

5) presentation - graphics, music, sound effects - everything's gorgeous, period :P

6) difficulty - this is a difficult game. It's because of the combination of randomly generated enemies and dungeons, loadout and skill upgrades, precision in platforming, patterns recognition and ability to fight a bunch of the enemies at the same time. Which brings me to pretty much my only pet peeve with this game:

No post hit invincibility - it's a deliberate design decision, but certain enemies in this game can hit you multiple times in a very short period of time. It makes the game much more deadly to the player and sometimes it gives you literally no chance to recuperate. But that's ninja's life I suppose. Be precise or die :P

Overall, this game is a gem in the genre and it's already great despite being in early stages of development.

427520,Factorio,2/29/2016,False,"Let me first say I love this game and I have been an alpha backer for a long time before Factorio hit steam. So don't get confused over the little playtime steam shows I have.

I've put hundreds of hours into Factorio, some uninterrupted sessions being over a dozen hours long having the most awesome intellectual stimulating happy time ever gnawing my knuckles bloody while trying to optimize my oilrefinery.

Factorio is a unique mashup of the survival/craft/minecraft genre with its own niche and right to exist, because it focusses mainly on designing production flows, which nearly no other game does especially in that depth.
Anybody who liked Infinifactory will love Factorio, as it is basically its more sincere older brother in 2D.

What bothers me though is, that while the dev team is great at staying in contact with the community and decent in polishing the game and the engine in particular the game still has no endgame content.

Myself, as a player, desperately needs goals to work towards, and no, self created goals dont work for me, 
I need a carrot to work towards, and I consistently will grow more and more unhappy the longer I have no carrot to target.
Call me uncreative, or achievementaddicted, that might be true, but I swear I'm not alone with that problem.

The current hight of feelings in that regard is the spacerocket, which has turned out to be the last and only goal of Factorio for over one year now. The absurd spacerockets resourcerequirements is an obvious hint that the devs ran out of creativity at that point, and once reached trying to finish the spacerocket in lesser time is nothing I can destilate much enjoyment out of.

There are similar red exclamationmarks in design of that game, for example the totally pointless existence of the native alien race that currently exist just to be an annoyance, since the diplomatic system has been announced for over a year now.

Or let me give another example: the one dimensional evolution of energy production. 
The single and only source of energy - until lategame, when one has solar energy; is steamengines, which turn once one solved the logistics of them just into another annoyance. Restrictions grow creativity, yet every rerun of the game one only has the most efficient path to follow instead of having to choose between different technology trees or being restricted on some buildings (aquatic powergeneration comes to mind).

Regarding lategame: Things like implementing a placeholder system that pushes out demands of goods to produce and deliver once one is in space or similar would be incredibly easy, yet it is completely overlooked, even while a part of the community craves these features.

There even have been dozens of decent suggestions on reddit and the forums in which directions the game could develop from that point, even as hilarious as turning it into a x4ish space economy sim.

As long as this state continues, and Factorio basically is a proof of concept and not a game I can't motivate myself to play it again. And month for month when scrolling through my steam library looking what to play I'll pause for a sad silent moment over Factorio, sighingly remembering the good times I had with it, when stuff was new and thinking about what this awesome game could be if it solved these easy problems hindering it from reaching awesomeness.

Is Factorio worth your 20 $? 
   - Definitely, you'll probably get way more hours for your buck out of it compared to AAA titles 

Am I happy with it in it's current state? 
   - nope :(

275850,No Man's Sky,8/22/2016,False,"Let me preface everything by saying that I actually bought this game on impulse before watching the trailers.  
I like space, I like exploration, some of the early reviews were positive, so I bought it.  
I regret that impulsive decision.   
   
Take it from a 5 year veteran of Eve: Online this game is BORING.  
Imagine Eve minus the hordes of players trying to kill you, it's more boring than that.  
  
There is supposed to be septillions of stars and planets generated, but their algorithm is poor. This results in maybe 12 different planet types and 30 animal species. I'm being very generous with the planets, for the most part they are just different colors with a different icon showing you what is killing you today.
  
Now I wasn't expecting Spore like creature variety, but this is insulting. All of them look the same. There might be some slight variation between the crab like species trying to kill me, but I honestly couldn't tell. 

The entire game is far too easy, in my trek from the start to the center of the galaxy my shields dropped a total of maybe 10 times, I still don't know what the death screen looks like.   

The interface is utterly terrible. You have to hold to click EVERYTHING. I cannot fathom a reason this has to be for literally EVERYTHING. The galaxy map is the single worst aspect of the UI, a rather galaring flaw for something that wants to do space exploration. The path to the center is utterly useless, as I got close to the center it literally got stuck in a dead end. It ignores your hyperdrive upgrades meaning it's course will take you through about a dozen short hops and then abruptly stop, while you can reach the end in one jump or infact go much futher. There is a total disconnect between ""Distance from Center"" and ""Linear Distance"", 500ly for the former is about 1,500ly for the latter. You are down to luck for finding any particular location, even ones you've visited before.    

The game play is more or less a resource grind, you land on a planet, shoot at a rock with a mining laser, you leave the planet to go shoot at a different rock. There are NPC, they are of three races, all of which just stand or sit alone in one place. They never do anything, you can talk to them and maybe get a blue print or something, but thats it, there is no personality, not even real interaction.  

There was an Atlas quest line, that brought you to 10 admittedly rather spiffy looking space stations. Actually I lied, there are 4 rather spiffy looking space stations that are repeated a couple of times in no particular order. It starts no where and ends in a non ending. This may last you a couple of hours (or however long it takes you to realize the map system is trash and just jump to the end). But it pales in comparison to reaching the Galactic Center.  

Thats the final insult, what happens at the center. I'll rant in a spoilerific manner after the next paragraph. Suffice to say if we reached the center and had a planet sized MIDDLE FINGER to explore, this would still be less of a FUCK YOU than what we got. Because at least the Flipping Bird of God would be an object of interest and discussion.   
   
It was after I had played for a while that I went out and watched the trailers, holy shit I wanted to play that game, too bad it's not what I bought. I'm angry I wasted money buying this, I would have been furious if my expectations were that high. This isn't a case of a fandom hyping in a vacuum, the developers were outright lying to us. Not just in the trailers, but in the words they were speaking. Fuck this game.

You start jumping to the center, the game silently says ""nope"", plays prog rock as it holds the scroll backwards button on the map screen, fade to black and dumps you at the start of a new practically identical galaxy with all you stuff broken. I think it might even have gotten the color on my ship wrong. I can't tell because my game bugged out and put me in slow mo, and I was already fighting the urge to just toss my computer out a window. So no, you don't even get to see what is so shiny at the center of the universe, you just start over again.

Journal Entry 1 

After crash landing I have gathered all resources at the plane, walked a short distance from the crash and found a nice hill to build fire and setup camp. 

Journal Entry 2 

I went down to the beach and started fishing, found lots of beer bottles in the sand, I even found a tent pitched on the beach... where is everyone?? 

Journal Entry 3 

While setting up camp I saw a group of 3 tribesmen doing a beach patrol in the area where I was fishing, I didn't engage only observed them. Its getting dark now and I know now that im not alone. I'm not sure of these tribesmen's intentions but Its starting to rain and I need to build a shelter. I'm going to the woods to collect some logs.

Journal Entry 4 

While heading back with a fresh cut log I noticed multiple lit torches heading towards my camp, about 12 of them from what I counted, Indeed it appears there are many more tribesmen than I originally thought. They appear to be scanning my camp looking for survivors.

Journal Entry 5 

After observing the tribesmen for 10 or so mins I approached one of the females of the pack, she stared at me in shock for about 30 seconds then screamed and ran away. She did not attack... perhaps they are a friendly people after all! 

Journal Entry 6 

I should have just left them alone, apparently the female ran back to get the rest of the tribe.... I was attacked and chased, I was able to kill three of them before accidentally backing up off a cliff and falling to (what I thought was my death). 

Journal Entry 7 

I have awoken in a cave of hanging bodies, I am badly injured from my cliff fall and only have my terribly lit Bic lighter to guide my way through the cave.... this may be my last journal entry as I am starving and going to die soon....

524220,NieR:Automata,6/11/2017,True,"This game is a masterpiece. Yes, it's imperfect, and has defaults, but if it reaches you, it goes deep, and you're not likely to forget it. Ever. On that somewhat random chance, I recommand this game.

Now, let's talk about perfection and imperfection. Starting by imperfection, to act as a fair warning :

- the technical aspect of the game seems not quite on par with what's expected nowadays, and by that, I mean that many people have reported technical issues going from annoying to making the game unplayable. Myself, I stumbled unto two main problems : white screen of death when starting the game, solved by updating my graphic drivers, and a couple random crashes. So I guess I was lucky to get into the ""just annoyed"" gang.
- the game is not accessible. Many people state that it can be played whitout having played the first NIER, and while it is kinda true, the world's background is awesome, and knowing at least the synopsis of the previous game increases the overall experience a LOT. In the same spirit, the game has no auto-save feature, but a hard and old savepoints system, that unlocks only after the first 45 minutes. Yes, it means that you have to sit and play 45 minutes non-stop before saving. The tutorial is minimal, and thus you can easily die during those 45 minutes before having the chance to learn how to control the game. However, this ""questionnable"" decision is in fact deeply rooted in the core design of the game. It's one clear exemple of ""immersion over practicality"". While I criticize it, I also encourage you to accept it and push through, as it is really worth it.

To sum it up : yes, this game will require some efforts from your side, perhaps more than what it should, and certainly not what we're accustomed to nowadays. Even so, it's worth it, because now I'll talk about maybe not perfection, but greatness.

- graphically, I always place art design and coherence above technical prowess. You can criticize the graphics all you want, but the art design is top-notch, and I'm not only talking about the fanservicy first look of the game, but about the quality of pretty much everything else, from character design to animations. The style is well-define and brings something special, an identity to the title.
- but that identity wouldn't be complete without the beautiful soundtrack, one of the best I've ever heard, one that will stick with you for a long time, akin to the legendary Ghost in the Shell theme, if you happen to know it. That's the kind of soundtrack you have here.
- after the look and the sound, we have the gameplay, and let me tell you that it's a stunning achievement. Nier Automata provides one of the most customizable experience I know, combined with thematic reflexions about the video game medium. Just that. Yes, you can over-level and make the game incredibly easy...but you can also just select a harder difficulty, and/or not use certain core interface element like showing your life bar. Platinium Games has a very good reputation for crafting action combat, and they do deliver here with a very satisfying amount of weapon and skills that you can combine in different playstyles, and just watching your character fight is a feast for the eyes. Now, just let me ramble a bit about people complaining about the difficulty,  at any point of the game. There is no difficulty achievement. With the amount of care this game has been made, it's not an oversight. It's just that you, the player, have to choose how you are playing. I'll admit, there is no in-game guide about it, it comes from tweaks you have to make. Will I go for all the side-quests? Will I farm the best items? Will I play in Very Hard? Only one answer : try it until you find your style, and if you're not happy, push through, and make your own rules. So rarely have you that amount of freedom over your experience.
- and finally, the story. While it may not be the best, the narration in itself is very well done, and is articulated around twists and revelations. And yes, it may seem artificial and even weak at times. But that's not even what's the most important about it. Because this story touches philosophy. Not the kind you find in books, but the kind you stumble on when you stop your everyday life to think a bit about your life and your place in the universe. Sure, there are references to known philosophers, but the philosophic and metaphysics thoughts and concepts presented are not dry and complex, they're intertwined in the narrative, making them much more accessible, and engaging. This, imho, is the biggest achievement of Nier Automata. It's showing that entertainment can be thought-provoking, that video games, and Games in general, ARE important, and have a rightful place alongside other forms of Arts, like literature or film-making.

So, yes, I genuinely think this is a masterpiece, and hope it will have a big impact on the gaming industry. Because there have already been incredible video games in the past, but never with that amount of self-awareness. This game is a weird case of fulfilled ambition without pretense, and one last time, I encourage you to look past the imperfections. Yes, it's worth it.",27714,10600,76561198060932700,14,68.45 hrs

377160,Fallout 4,11/13/2015,False,"This game bothers me. For everything it advances, it has taken a step back in the areas players would enjoy. On one hand, I am overwhelmed by the improved gunplay, the settlements, and the improvements to familiar monsters. But this game fails to deliver on player expectations for the series. We didn't buy fallout for gunplay and monsters, or to play minecraft. We bought fallout to experience a world, to lose ourselves in the story, and feel immersed in the wasteland - and fallout has not just taken steps back, they've fully disengaged from this immersion. 

The immersion breaking is the hardest part for this game. NPCs you encounter can be summarized by the dialog wheel: [Tell me your Backstory in 3 sentences] [Give me a quest] [Give me extra money for this quest] [I'll do this quest later.] The deepest an NPC might get into telling you their backstory is two or three choices to get told a little more vague details about them. Even iconic factions with rich lore, like the Brotherhood of Steel, give you barely any backstory or information. Ask them about what values the Brotherhood holds? ""Most of that should be evident by the fight we were just in. Also, we value honor and truth. And stuff."" 

As a final nail in the coffin, the game handcuffs you to the Father/Mother story. If you enter this game expecting to have freedom to ignore the story, then, don't go near any important NPC anywhere. The more interesting an NPC seems on the surface, the more likely they are going to force you into the worst kind of dialog imaginable: The No Choice But Yes. Without spoiling anything, my first encounter in Diamond City was a cool young lady, reminescent of Moira from Fallout 3. Eccentric and fun, I was hoping for some Moira-style quests, but, her first dialog is an interview where she tells you that you are a vault dweller instantly without asking and puts you into a question about your character's son that gives you four choices: [Stop Asking me] [Vague Answer] [Why are you asking me] [Son] - Except, each time you choose, she says, No! Choose [Son]. NO! CHOOSE [SON]. NO!!!! DO YOUR STORY! NOW! 

No one will read this review and decide to not buy this game. This is a fact of life. However, I can only hope that by adding my negative review, it continues to make the review scores more suspicious. Bethesda failed me with this game, by stepping away from the deep roleplaying aspects and giving me a shallow sandbox to play in.

582160,Assassin's Creed Origins,11/19/2017,True,"After several days of heavy playing and finally finishing the whole story, I'm bringing myself back here to write my very first game review. I started playing the AC series from AC2 which is an epic game. Besides the rises and falls of public opinion toward this brand name, I've always liked the past AC games (yes, even the Unity which everybody shitted on). Game makers are trying very hard to continue the story, and I truly appreciate their efforts. 

Some of the best things about ACO that I really like:

1. Architecture. This is the best thing about AC games. For me, it's since I first ""ran"" across Venice Rooftops. I could just sit at the top of the Pyramid of Giza and stare at this fabulous world all day long. 

2. Combat. Alright, I have complex feelings about this one. Combat is really hard compared to previous AC games, where you could basically just do counters and take down as many guards as there possibly are. Being surrounded would be a nighare in ACO when you're not well-equipped enough. Luckily boss battles are not hell because you mostly only need to deal with one, and then you can truly analyze their attacking patterns and fight accordingly. BTW, I started using long-ranged predator bows to assassinate most of the normal guards. Super fun controlling the arrow in air and headshotting around the corner, and helps you avoid so much conflict.

3. Resource gathering. I think this is where the game makers really gave some thoughts. You never have excess money or resources, but you never lack a whole lot of them either. You won't have to spend a lot of time to gather some key resources for one or two important upgrade that might get you through one major quest. Super equipments are not hard to get either, Reda the You Also Grow Too Fast kid sells this chest in which legendary ranked stuff are not scarce. All these make the balance just about right between going through the main story and doing random training and gathering to leveling up. 

4. Photo mode. Haha this one is just SUPER! This could keep some people playing for a long while. Now those beautiful sceneries would never be wasted again. And you have a bunch of options to play with to make your favorite photo. Also, you can see other amazing photos taken by other players as well in the map tab. Also, those photos might contain information about the location as well, sometimes useful.

5. Senu. She is the Origin of the Eagle Vision and she is the BEST so far. This system helps you locate objects, treasures, animals, enermies and even entrances, but you do have to manually scan the map to pin them all. Again, I think it's just about right in terms of balance.


That being said, some other not too positive thougts too.
6. Level system. This kind of started since Syndicate where the ability points system is introduced. But... you have to upgrade hidden blade damage, or otherwise you can't even do half hp damage to a high level captain or commander when ""assassinating"" from behind? That just feels weird. Thankfully leveling up and collecting material to upgrade, say your hidden blade (at least to a ""usable"" degree for your current mission) would not be too much of a hassle, otherwise this system would be really annoying.

7. Story. 
7.1 I really liked Bayek's story, but I don't see why... alright I'm not turning myself into a spoiler. Anyways, I see others complaining that every AC game gives a new definition of the Creed, but I kinda disagree with that. Nobody said that game makers advocated what they where conveying through the characters. We see that in AC3 where the game itself spoke for Haythem's Templar logic and criticized Conner's brute work to some extent. The debate between ideologies never stopped, and as a game series, I think AC is still handling itself okay in this context. I believe that if you have played AC3 before, you would probably feel as I do that Bayek is not much better than Conner when Conner started his journey. But the idea Bayek and Aya put forward toward the end of ACO did make sense and was a good explanation for the Origin of the brotherhood. But besides from that, I still find the story lacking the impact I had when playing AC2, Revelations, Black Flag or Rogue. 
7.2 In addition, the modern timeline didn't progress much either... I'm really not interested in picking up all the novels and stuff, and I know none of the characters in ACO except for William Miles (whom I only know as much as that he is Desmond's father). I'll just wait for the next AC game and see if the modern timeline could make any sense. I hope it does. Well, you could actually find clues in ACO but... Again, I'm not gonna be a spoiler.

8. Music. It's nowhere near bad. Actually I think it's good and immersive. But Venice Rooftops and Ezio's Family just couldn't be beaten. 

To the end of this pile of rubbish I just talked, I like this game very much. But I guess that nobody actually cares, lol. Those who are not interested will probably still not buy this game after reading all those positive reviews, and those who are interested already bought and shot the sh*t out of Anubis haha.

Depsite promising to not introduce Microtransactions during Early Access they now introduce a crate that requires you to buy a key for 2,50$ to open it. Limited time only of course, so people feel the need to open them to not miss out the skins.

The game had potential, even sold 5,350,698 copies (according to SteamSpy). Yet they still feel the need to dry out customers even more.

Not recommended. This is going to turn into another microtransaction-hell. Stay away.

I never thought i would have 3000 people rating my review.

1.) People who dislike this review and feel the need to be aggressive about it, write extremly offensive things here or on my profil just for the sake of expressing their disagreement are not what the gaming community needs. Honestly, get a hold of yourself.

2.) I keep getting comments about ""its only cosmetics, why do you even care lol"". 
Well, it's not all about the cosmetics. You misunderstood. The problem is the fact that PU directly lied into our faces and is apprently getting away with it. 

3.) If you dont care about the Micro-shit - thats okay! But respect people's opinion about it if they care. If 50% don#t care, and 50% do care, but don't want it -> The easiest solution would be to NOT have Microtransactions. That way everybody is happy.

4.) The main point. They lied about this, what else do / will they lie about. They lost all of their trust. Nothing they promise us can be taken for granted anymore. Sadly, that virtue seems to be non-existent nowaday - Honesty.

382310,Eco,2/17/2019,False,"Okay so first of all, yes, I'm giving this a positive review (after writing this I've switched it to negative so the devs might read it). Even with its current problems (which I will get to in the second half), Eco is a one-of-a-kind game that offers something not currently available, and also does it with a great design in both graphical style and gameplay. However, read the second half of this review if you're thinking of a purchase.

So what kind of game is this and who is it for? It's a game about paving the untamed wilds and forming a civilization, complete with an economy. If you're the kind of player who likes to tear down a jungle and turn it into a city, this is a great game. The pacing is slow compared to something like, say, Minecraft, but it's faster paced than other games in the genre like Wurm Online.

I'd say there's two halves to this game: one is the actual digging and construction, and the other half is working with other players (sometimes total strangers) and forming an economy. And this second part is where a lot of people are leaving negative reviews, but I think that they're missing the intended experience: if your whole world goes to shit and nobody cooperates, that IS the game. You did not have a failed experience. Just sit back and laugh at the drama.

Now, that being said, be prepared to throw your expectations of other people out the window. Otherwise, you're gonna have a bad time. No other game has got me swearing at my neighbours and fellow players more than this game. Many people are selfish. They're greedy. They hoard all the resources for no reason. Sometimes everybody's prices are completely insane. At least in a game where people are shooting at you, you know who your enemies are. Well how about a situation where you're selling a whole ton of building materials for the lowest price on the server, and your neighbour is complaining that nobody has any building materials for sale. So you remind him about your fantastic stock and prices, and he just goes ""oh yea i forgot about that"" and then continues to not buy anything from you for days, weeks, ever. Why does he not buy anything from you? Oh geez who knows, man. Maybe it's because your house is bigger than his and he's jealous of your success. Maybe he's a total dimwit. Who knows, who knows. But that's Eco. And yes this is a real thing that happened.

So that being said, don't run into this expecting to experience the cooperation of a Utopian society. You'll mostly want to just burn the whole world to the ground and everybody in it. But my advice is to stick it through until a server dies and then move on to the next one, because all servers offer a completely different experience. One server I was on, nobody was buying what I was producing. Another server I logged onto had 5 buy orders of 999 for it. It completely depends on who you're playing with, but at the same time, not knowing how the economy is going to develop is part of the fun, as well as trying to adapt to those weird conditions.

OKAY NOW ALL THAT BEING SAID HERE IS THE SECOND HALF OF THIS REVIEW:

At least one of the coders at Strange Loop Games lied on his resume. Parts of this game code are absolute HOT GARBAGE. I have never played a game that is as badly programmed as this one. I can not stress how badly this is coded, and let me get into the details.

So first of all, the game now uses more than 7 gigs of ram while running. So if you've got 8 gigs of ram and you also run windows? SOL. Okay, strangely high requirements, that's not so bad. But get this: the more stockpiles on a server, the slower the game runs until it becomes unplayable. Yes, that's right, stockpiles. A pile of stuff that just sits there. Oh no, it shouldn't do anything until you access it, but for some reason only the guy who coded it knows, the stockpiles are actively thinking about something constantly because the more of them in a server, plainly and simply, the worse the server runs. They don't even have to be near you to slow things down. And being a stockpile in a game about industry, you need them. The more stockpiles you can have means the more efficient your business can deal with the logistics of storage, but also the laggier your game gets at all frames. It's like every frame the game draws it needs to ask all the stockpiles if they're feeling okay, first.

Okay let us continue. When you cut a square of grass, the FPS drops by 80% for FIVE SECONDS following the cut. It's like it has to consult ALL THE GRASS IN THE CHUNK everytime you cut one piece of grass. Why does it do this? Gee I don't know, only the coder can tell us.

Well the game runs bad, so you turn your resolution down. Well guess what? It's not really rendering the lower resolution properly. It's actually taking that resolution of 1280x720 and STRETCHING THE IMAGE AND RENDERING IT AT 1920x1080. I have never seen a game do this. It blows my mind. So in order to get the actual performance improvement, you have to turn down the native resolution of windows, and then boot the game into the lower resolution. Again, I have never seen a game behave like this! It's scares me! What kind of madman programmed this mess and how did they even get it to do that? To further perplex the user, if you don't turn down the native resolution of windows, not only will you not get the performance improvement of the lower resolution but every once in awhile the game will hang for 20 seconds and randomly switch your resolution back to 1920x1080 without asking. what?? how??? huh????

Do you want to turn off graphical features like light rays coming through the leaves from the sun? Well too bad, because the game switches them back on after 3 seconds. Why? OH MY GOD I DON'T KNOW WHY!

One time I was dragging a piece of plant seed from a stockpile to my backpack, and when the game hung on a frame it showed the entire view window had the graphic rendered over it at full screen with 50% transparency. WHY? Why would this be a thing that happens during the process of dragging an icon from one container to the other? Why would it choose to render it at fullscreen at 50% transparency for a frame? Just to make it run slower?

Okay so continuing, there's a new bug where when you mine stone, about up to about 30% can lag out, disappear, and rain down on the surface above your mine. But what I've come to realize is that while this happens with granite, limestone, and sandstone, it does not happen with shale. How can the code for 3 rocks be so different than 1? Did they re-code the new stone types from scratch?

In the new version they said they were going to increase visibility and optimize chunk loading, and now the chunks just don't load for anybody. You can move along at a walking pace and you still have to wait seconds for the next chunk in front of you to load. Yes that means you can't see further than 5 feet in front of you (if at all) when you're exploring the game world. This didn't happen in version 7, and now, with what they call OPTIMIZATIONS, nobody can render chunks properly anymore.

I used to think I was the only person with the graphics turned so low, but every screenshot from every person on the server I'm on, all 6 of us who are left after 25 stopped playing, are running the game at the lowest graphics setting at resolutions equal or lower to 1280x720.

Oh yea and to top it all off, the new version has a big ol memory leak. Have you heard that word since 2003? Oh wow do memory leaks bring me back. I thought we were done with them but no, here's a blast from the past. Enjoy restarting your game every 30 minutes as it gradually begins to hang for up to 20 seconds or longer.

Okay so all that being said, with all the bugs present and the current code being an absolute enigma of steaming dog-doodoo, this game can be fixed and it can be fixed in 6 months if they get a new lead coder.

Pros
[list]
[*]Better shooter mechanics. There's no denying this. F3/NV suck in comparison.
[*]Weapon customisation. When you get your head around it, it's a fun system.
[*]Sound and Music are really great, both in terms of content and their implementation
[*]Graphics are great, both technically and thematically
[*]Animations are much improved from earlier Bethesda titles
[*]No more ""Arrow in the knee"" repetition, random NPCs comments are nicely varied. They even have special lines for certain dates (like December 25)
[*]The vertibird and artillery additions are Bethesda seeing popular mods from earlier Fallouts and implementing them into the core game in a way that fleshes out the world. Whilst one could argue both are pointless, they add a nice bit of life to the world.
[*]I prefer the new power armour system, I think if the original Fallouts could've done something similar, they would have. It fits their presentation in the game lore more accurately.
[/list]

Neutral
[list]
[*]Settlement system is interesting, but the explanation is nearly non-existent and the tutorial is a joke. Some serious changes to the game world as you setup dozens of prosperous, populated and linked settlements would've been a nice touch to reward the effort. Occasionally seeing a minuteman patrol or a inter-settlement supply caravan is not much. As it is you mostly do it for its own sake.
[*]The junk to build system is interesting, it also helps to serve as a cap sink. It can lead to frustrating amounts of junk hoarding though and there are a illogical breakdowns.
[*]The factions and their motivations are interesting. It's clear the BOS in this game is a direct response to all the criticism Bethesda got for changing their ethos in Fallout 3. Neutral point because it's never really fleshed out in any interesting way for any faction, just a stream of glorified ""clear the building"" quests.
[*]The game is buggy. But this is an open world game, so it's to be expected and can't really be held against the game.
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*]Reduction of every single stat and skill down to the perks system, effectively kills the fun of character customisation. Allowing the rapid acquisition of SPECIAL points makes initial character creation feel meaningless and kills replay value.
[*]Dialogue is almost pointless now, options are severely limited and you don't know what you'll actually say. The walking conversation system leads to lots of bugs with NPCs ending conversations mid-stream or you having to jerk the mouse around to get them to continue.
[*]Quests are all rail shooter quests. On the rare occasion you get a choice it's almost invariable a black and white choice at the very end of the quest chain. Really crap in comparison to New Vegas's brilliant branching quests (not that it too didn't have its fair share of rail quests, but here that is all we get).
[*]Companions are really shallow. I've barely said a dozen sentences to Piper and now she's in love with me? There is no real character arc for any of them and they all join you on a dime.
[*]The two characters you're meant to care for the most, your son and wife, are in the game for all of 30 mins and you never develop any connection. I've seen 10 mins cinematics do a better job. The main quest line feels forced as a result. I felt more for the Vault Tec sales guy turned ghoul than my son.
[*]The radiant quests are painful. When a settlement has a settler captured for the fifth time, by the same pack of raiders in the same school I've cleared out five times, it gets a little tiresome. They also clog up your quest list, especially if you join BOS, Minutemen and the Railroad.
[*]Bethesda still don't seem to understand that Fallout is set centuries after the nuclear apocalypse. There should be some semblance of a rebuilt society. Exploring the weird way in which societies have rebuilt themselves is half the fun of Fallout 1/2/NV. 200 years and the ""jewel of the commonwealth"" is a shanty town with 20 people? In this world it seems like the bombs dropped 20 years ago, not 200. 
[/list]

Summary: it's still worth the money and it is a good game for what it is: an adventure FPS. This review would be positive if they'd just remove Fallout from the title. As they won't I will judge it as a Fallout game, in which case it is a disappoinent.

281990,Stellaris,5/10/2016,True,"Edit: As of writing this review, I have 20 hours logged in Stellaris.  Stellaris has been out for 29 hours.

This is the story of those 20 hours.

My friends and I all arranged to play stellaris together on release.  I didn't know what to play until I remembered that happiness is a core game mechanic - unhappy people rebel, happy people don't.  I don't want rebellions, those make people even more unhappy.  If I took ""Spiritualist,"" I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness.  Even better, if I grabbed ""Fanatic Spiritualist"" I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions ever.

It wasn't deep enough.

I found the communal trait, which adds +5% happiness, and the charismatic trait, which gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planet.

I had to go deeper

I found out that by balancing my racial attributes, national ethics, and even my form of government, I was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness.  I ended up as a fanatically spiritual, pacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone.  To top it off, I found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alien, the kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about ""Alien abductions.""  Classic grays, but with a big, doofy grin slapped permanently across their faces.

My friends all started on the opposite side of the galaxy from me, so I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI.  It didn't matter what I did, my people remained happy.  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain.  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movement, distributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld.  I shipped them across my empire, balancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of world, after all.  

And we were all so, so happy.

But we needed more friends.

So I found some primitives, who hadn't achieved spaceflight yet.  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them.  Then, of course, I began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic community.

I then genetically modified the boars to be just as happy as we are.  This is where this game is, now:  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxy, making and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxy, where I've spent my time well:  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happy, just like us.

Thanks to this game, I have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals week.
And I have no regrets.

Update from 5/11:

I managed to explore around an unexplored chunk of the outer rim, finding several of my friends.  Meanwhile, I enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit.  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of them, as the other was naturally happy.

My alliance with the angry fungus was expanded with the addition of my super-xenophile cat-neighbors.  Fully 1/3 of the galaxy's cat-people population quickly migrated to my planets and set out being so productive and so happy as a result of being surrounded by my people that engineering them would actually be a waste of resources.

The Alien loving cats, the angry fungus, and I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and ""liberating"" all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethics.

The entire time my friends were wailing, moaning, and there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies until, after 15 years of war, they managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peace.

My friend Joe wasn't so lucky and couldn't secure an alliance with the rest of my friends on their side of the galaxy before the same non-player empire declared war on Joe, took one planet, liberated another under its own new government, and vassalized him.

That's when we saved and quit until next time:
In summary:
I'm slowly increasing in power and enlightening more races into blissful happiness as my friends are at constantly at war and Joe is getting vassalized by non-player empires.",97028,1012,76561198038075800,13,65.47 hrs
377160,Fallout 4,11/15/2015,True,"I'm not gonna write a super in depth review right now but I will say I do recommend this game. I like it more than fallout 3 but I think New Vegas is still the best ""modern"" fallout game. Anyway, here are my pros and cons after over 40 hours

Pros:
-Exploration is even better than Fallout 3, tons of stuff to find in a dense environment
-Gunplay is vastly improved, VATS is no longer essential but its still fun to use. Guns have proper recoil and several different stats including fire rate, range and damage
-Story is more of a ""its okay"" but its solid enough for me to put it in pros, but keep it mind its iffy on if you'll like it or not.
-Followers have some backstory and relevance, they aren't just a means to throw your junk so you can keep carying more junk. Although they still function as that. Being able to lose a follower because you do things they don't like, is also pretty cool.
-The game runs well FOR ME. I understand other people are having issues, but it runs just fine so far for me. I've had one crash, and only a few minor bugs. I do understand that there are serious issues, don't try to call me a fanboy just because I personally didn't have issues, I recognize they exist
-Aosphere and asthetic are much better than fallout 3. Theres actually color and it looks pretty good! Its not 10/10 in the looks deparent but its not horrible.
-The dialogue itself is better than fallout 3. The dialogue selection and protagonist voice? I'll get to that in the cons.

Cons:
-UI Is horrible. A mod is needed for this ASAP, its a pain in the ass to sort through
-Voiced protagonist is a step backwards and makes roleplaying harder. I'm sure mods will fix this but that does not excuse how poorly executed the voice protagonist was. It doesn't ruin the game for me but if your into fallout for Roleplaying and story, it could ruin it for you.
-Bugs. The bugs I've encountered have just been humorous and not game breaking, but game breaking bugs do exist and people have had them. If even minor bugs bother you, I'd wait for a few patches.
-PC port missing options. However there is a mod for this on the nexus that lets you fix a lot of issues. 

Overall, I really love fallout 4 and think its much better than 3. However, New Vegas is still the best fallout game to me, Fallout 4's story and characters don't come close to being as good as New Vegas. Still, a great game and I highly recommend it.

4000,Garry's Mod,12/23/2014,True,"Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.

""Where do I start?"" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...

_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.

_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.

_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.

_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.

_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.


Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 7/10
Story: N/A
Sound: 8/10
Replayability: 10/10

Overall 8.5

Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod

262060,Darkest Dungeon¬Æ,6/20/2018,True,"[h1][b][u]Disclaimer:[/u] There is an ongoing issue with the Korean translation. In response to that, many players are leaving a negative review to stick it to the developer. In my humble opinion, the game itself is good. My level of information concerning the translation √©clat is very superficial, but I must stress that before you believe any statements, please do the educated thing and research this topic a bit. Thanks for staying objective here, now on to the actual review.[/b][/h1]

With age, I have come to appreciate more challenging games like the Dark Souls Series. It always takes a bit of an effort, because if you want to succeed in such games, you need to deal with the mechanics and principles behind the gameplay and deepen your knowledge. My philosophy with Dark Souls was always that it was not hard in itself as long as you listened to the game's ""messages"" and acted accordingly.

Darkest Dungeon is similar at heart. But the difference is that you won't reach a state of overtraining which allows you some easy farming. Instead, your heroes will refuse to go on low level missions once they have earned their wings. The conclusion is that planning is key. You need to get a mental grip on the game really fast and then plan the development of your hamlet along with the development of your heroes. And once you have accepted that the heroes are expendable, the world won't look so grim anymore!

The [b]gameplay[/b] is pretty straightforward: You have a team of four heroes, each of which comes with 4 active skills and their current equipment. You go on a mission with a clear goal and with limited resources that cost you gold for each piece you chose to take along. In combat, you have a maximum of 4v4 scenario with turn based combat. The outcomes are influenced by chance, e.g. your damage range might be 5 - 10, which would make a 10 lucky and a 5 unlucky. In that regard, it is very much like a classical RPG when it comes to stats, abilities and chance.
So if you have an idea of your heroes, the area and the game in general, you can plan ahead and even prevail if RNG is trying to ra...ttle you! It happens that you get wrecked, but if you learn from that experience, you wil know what to improve for the next try.

With my current expertise with the game, I'd say the [b]difficulty[/b] remains challenging and taxing even as you get stronger. There are basically 3 tiers of enemy strengths, and once your heroes reach a higher level, they need to go on higher tier missions, as previously pointed out. Gold and resources for the developent of your hamlet are limited and you need to manage your playstyle in a way that does not leave you bankrupt after a few missions. Chosing which heroes to improve and which to let go is a part of that: Your heroes get positive and negative quirks (attribute modifiers) which can be healed or locked, as well as maladies. It's not always worth to spend your hard earned moola on a hero who has taken a wrong turn. So again, an appropriate reaction is key.
[i]EDIT: In radiant difficulty, you can use higher level heroes for lower level missions. Yay!
EDIT2: But you can't take Champion level heroes (5+) on lowest level missions in radiant.[/i]

The [b]artstyle[/b] is neat and the [b]sounds and music[/b] suit the theme that the game is set in. This is not a happy place game, so don't expect a cheerful tune.

The [b]game runs smoothly [/b](at least for me) and I have not yet experienced any problems or crashes. I play without any mods.

I do not own the [b]DLCs[/b], so I can't comment on them. But the changes to the core game that came with the DLC seem to be reasonable. The devs have their vision of Darkest Dungeon and so they do not allow cheesing, which is fine by me. So if other reviews put that down as a negative point, then i'd wager they were too lazy to play the game the way it was intended and are now out of their depths with what they have left.


If you have read all the gibberish above, I would like to thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts. There is more to the game than I have written down here, but I don't need to make a dissertation out of it and I have faith that you get the idea of the game by looking at the pictures and watching the videos provided by the dev. I can really recommend Darkest Dungeon, provided that you can manage the above mentioned hurdles. It's not a game to relax and it can drive you up the walls, so don't play when you're already salty. ;)

[spoiler]And if you need to cheer up, I can really really recommend the game ""Slime Rancher"" for that! It's too cute![/spoiler]",80623,1025,76561198014341000,18,64.85 hrs
413150,Stardew Valley,6/6/2017,True,"This game has so much thought and detail put into it. From the little kiss you can give your spouse in the morning, to finding the Mayors underwear in a special someones home, or a little flying witch that could bring you gifts if you are lucky. As a person with very intense anxiety this game helps to calm me down and relax. 

Soundtrack and Music - The soundtrack is very calming and peaceful. It's very comforting to listen to as you water crops or mine in the cave. There is always a different song for different events giving it a nice feel good vibe. 

Art and Graphics - The game is so beautiful. The art is very adorable and indie. With each different season and each new event or festival you have more quests and more to explore and it all is so stunning.

Characters - The characters are so in depth. They all have a different back story to why they are who they are. They also are mostly kind and sweet once they get used to you and you get used to them.

This game is so much fun and it really goes in depth. This game is one that you can lose track of real time because of how enticing it is. Once you start to get the hang of it there is no putting it down. Then you discover mods which add more game time because they add more to explore. 

Overall, the is very fun and beautiful. If you want a good quality and long lasting game this is the game for you.

Down side - There isn't much to say about this game that is bad, especially since mods help make it better. I would love to see working multiplayer to enjoy in game expierence with friends. One other thing is, there is not much of a tutorial for a new player it can be very confusing. It can be confusing on what to do, or how important birthdays are and such can be. But besides these small things the game is amazing.",56765,1262,76561198144719700,3,64.73 hrs

Pros
[list]
    [*] You really fall in love with the art style and dark, industrial setting. Also the lighting is absolutely gorgeous. (seriously, look at those sunsets at The Hound Pits pub)
    [*] The map design is brilliant with dozens of optional routes to take and ways to complete objectives. (After playing some missions for the 4th time I was still finding pathways I hadn't taken before)
    [*] You're completely free to play how you would like to - never be detected, set off every alarm there is, kill everyone with crazy rat swarms and traumatise a child or keep your hands super clean. Or just completely wing it.
    [*] As there are not endless cutscenes and the game is split into missions, it's really replayable. It's fun to try a new playthrough of the game completely different to your last one and I do feel this game should be replayed to fully appreciate the different mechanics and everything the game has to offer.

Cons
[list]
    [*] ""SHOULD WE GATHER FOR WHISKEY AND CIGARS TONIGHT?"" will drive you insane after the 20th time.
    [*] If you don't save often and are going for a stealth, no-kills run, YOU'RE SCREWED. The game can be buggy and the controls can mess up especially when going for non-lethal takedowns. So just save a LOT if you care about the acheivements..
    [*] Yeah, the storyline is pretty short but is thankfully made up for in gameplay.

356190,Middle-earth: Shadow of War,10/10/2017,False,"So First off i played this game offline and online. a 40+ hours
However there is a few things that is bad and a few things that is good.

**********************
Update 5 Finalized last update

All microtransactions has been removed.
As we all saw from the start the microtransactions had impacted the game severly and monolith decided to remove it to fix the nemesis systems problems.
There is a patch note and a Developer interview in wich they say that microtransactions did cause problems within the game to obtain orcs the correct way much as i have covered on earlier.
BUT now the game has been fixed the market is disabled all training orders and orcs are now ready to be used INSIDE the game for free!
and surprise surprise ""legendary orcs are now easier to find in open world!"" 
did not see that comming ? :p
anyways the market and microtransactions are out and the game is fixed Enjoy sadly 8 months to late or so ?
*********************************

Update 4!
After some time after release monolith has now planned for officially removeing the market and all the micro lootboxes and predatory mechanics from the game ( sucked people dry )
Legendary orcs will now be more avaiable in the open world and so will training orders.
Basicly all we said from the start is now being put back into the game from the lootboxes after they sucked market dry! good thing for players sad that it had to go to such extension as to make laws forbid lootboxes before it was removed.

Update2!
For once this will be a good point and update.
With the first dlc released Slaughter Tribe they will be makeing Shadow wars Endless ( free update with or without additional dlc purchase )
This is a good step in right direction hopefully they will solve aloot of the other problems as well later down the road.

Lets take bad part first.
Update3!

Pitfight AI sometimes can be broken and the orcs just stand there for a minute and then suddenly go berzerk and kill some one. possible bugg ?

Update!
After about 40-50 hours into the game i started getting aloot of IronWilled Orcs wich makes them Impossible to dominate. 
This is no doubt a lockbox Mechanic wich is aimed at you haveing harder time to get a orc dominated.
It was not in first game shadow of mordor for sure.
IronWilled can be removed at a super low chance ( so far my chances have been 1 in 29 shames ) while you shame an orc but heres the kicker.
If you shame an orc they have a chance to became deranged wich makes them lose their personality.
Also ( if you have certain skill have  chance to make them a maniac wich can be quite insane strong but if ironwilled then they will proboly be hard time to deal with )
Or in my case i ended up with aloot of very weak orcs and deranged and still ironwilled.
Now this mechanic is aimed at you haveing a slower time to get orcs so you get bored and buy lootbox orcs i have no doubt in my mind about this. 
This only happened later down in the game and well it sucks to be frank.
I found some very cool orcs i wanted but since they IronWilled i cannot get them without risking them to become insane and lose all their personality.
VERY poor game mechanic.

So Monolith lied about a few things in their interviews and such.
First of all they said there would be no advertisements on lootboxes ingame in a published interview. But as soon as you open the game and anytime ingame you play and press escape advertisement for lootboxes shows up. Wich is bad.

Next Monolith promised everything that was in lootboxes was in open world. This was also a lie. You see in the lootboxes you get scrolls that can customize your orcs. You do not get that in the open world only from lootboxes ( free or Pay boxes ) Below there is a few examples of what you get from lootboxes that is NOT in open world.

Battle Training (raises a follower's level by 1)
Archer Recruient (grants a follower an Archer Gang)
Hunter Recruient (Grants a follower a Hunter Gang)
Defender Recruient (Grants a follower a Defender Gang)
Mount Training (Grants a follower a caragor mount) 
Fire Training (Grants a follower a Fire Weapon)
Epic Training: Mighty Savages (Grants a follower a boost to the effectiveness of nearby Savages)
Poison Training (Grants a follower a Poison Weapon)
Mount Training Legendary (Grants a follower a Defencive Graug)

This list is INCOMPLETE we do not have all the traits scrolls here there is supposedly many many more locked inside the lootbox system and NOT avaible ingame. Below is a link to the official forum where people asked that this be put into the game and not into lootboxes Monolith preatty much ignored it.

https://community.wbgames.com/t5/General/Please-make-training-orders-and-reassignment-orders-avaliable/td-p/1656682

Next part that is bad about the game is Lootboxes in a single player game was kinda over the line and poorly done IF everything was inside the game offline as well as in lootboxes then ok np but it is not.
Other than micro transaction things the game suffers from a little bit repetive gameing syndrome you do aloooot of the same things over and over with very little changes.
Now that was the bad parts.

Lets go to the good parts.

Game features a very well made graphics engine and Npcs are well cordinated for the most part.

Story is good as far as i gotten and sound actors are good but maybe little bit low on volume and subtitles can be a hit and miss.

Optimisation is welldone i tested on my laptop and on my pc and both worked great.
have not encountered any buggs so far wich is good.

Nemesis version 2 engine is awesome! you will love it.
Skill system is a little bit weaird at first glance but you get the hang of it later.

You can respec free of charge at any given time great addition.

Id say if it was not for the lootboxes this would be a perfect game.

Now In conclusion If you do not mind microtransactions and some items being In Lootboxes only then you should buy this game. However if you do have something against microtransaction or you suffer from addiction disorders or similar problems DO NOT buy this game due to sublime advertisements in the menus.

I do not know if they will ban people who have fun with the game with mods or cheats or such but i hope they do not since this is a single player game.
There is a multiplayer section of the game but its like not worth mentioning couse its very very basic and limited.
anyways there you have my review.

PS the amount of bad decisions monolith and warner bros made when releaseing this game made the game dirt cheap before it was even released i got my copy 65% off from a retailer on gold edition.
you can proboly snag this game with gold edition 50% of at any given time from retailers or digital merchants.",76956,2077,76561197967468400,36,62.38 hrs
593600,PixARK,5/24/2019,False,"Let me start off by saying that calling this game version 1.0 is laughable. That's being respectable about it. Absolutely do not buy this game. It is NOT ready to be full release, and if you are expecting a game similar to Ark chock full of content, and hours upon hours of game play, this isn't it. I'm aware it was supposed to be a pixel version of Ark, which is fine, but to switch directions and add automation because of the success of Factorio/Satisfactory, is a slap in the face to anyone expecting anything of value from this title. I will once again say, absolutely do NOT buy this game. It wasn't worth 24.99, and it certainly isn't worth 39.99. This was a cash grab meant to profit off of the Ark IP further than already was done. If you want a game like this, just buy Ark. If you already own Ark, ignore this completely.

EDIT: This game was bought for, and tested by my 7 year old, who was bored to tears, started over repeatedly due to lack of content, and 90% of the time exited to just go play Ark. In other words, just go buy Ark

EDIT: After reading the patch notes, they don't even warrant a reinstall to play. Not worth the bandwidth or the money. I will chalk it up as a loss, and congratulate them on making 20 bucks off of me.

EDIT: Furthermore, look at the comments below to check out how great this community is. I talked bad about their precious ""completed game"" and my child gets called stupid. I was also banned from the forums for advocating against people buying this. To add to that, I was banned by the developer and not a moderator, if that gives you some insight as to the kind of people that run the show there.

EDIT: After all this time, the game hasn't improved even a smidgeon. Unless you consider controller support an improvement. (I do not, as the game was released on consoles, and should have shipped with it)",36494,1307,76561198014176200,13,62.30 hrs

239140,Dying Light,11/24/2015,True,"This game taught me many things about real life:

Episode 1: I was locked out of my house last week, and I realized I had a paper clip and pocket knife in my car. I figured, ""this will be a cinch"" I started to pick my lock: click, click. Sh%#. Paper clip broke. Yep, lock is ruined. 
*Hops wall, grabs key from under mat, and enters through back door* 
Wife: ""Why the hell did you come in from the back?"" Me: ""I locked myself out"" Wife: ""Why didn't you just knock?"" Me: ""I've been trying to learn parkour."" *parkour into back room* Pursuit evaded.

Episode 2: I have to take the trash out, but it's getting dark outside. Wife: ""the trash is still overflowing"" Me: ""True, but its almost dark. I don't think I can risk it."" Wife: ""Risk what?"" Me: *looks at couch; chooses to wait until morning* 
I wake up. Wife: ""now that it's light out, how about that trash?"" Me: ""HELL YEAH. DOING IT!"" *Grabs machete out of closet; ties up trash bag* Wife: ""what the hell is with the sword?"" Me: *parkour into front yard* Trash delivered. I feel stronger. 

Episode 3: It's night time. Wierd noise on roof. Feeling unusually brave, I grab my new teddy bear (aka my machete) from under my pillow. Using my parkour skills I climb up my aluminum rain gutter. Rain gutter buckles under my weight and I crash to the ground. Startled, the cat on my roof scampers away. Mission accomplished. 

Episode 4: My wife and I make dinner. I am cutting vegetables with a Hardened Beef Cleaver. I go to the bedroom and grab my Machete. I lay the Machete and Beef Cleaver on the counter. Me: ""Which of these is better?"" Wife: ""For what? Why have you been acting so wierd lately?"" Me: ""Agreed."" *Chops carrots with machete*

The Following taught me even more about real life: 

Episode 5: Been training for awhile now with Teddy. Let‚Äôs just say we eat a lot of squirrel for dinner. Came across a Javelina unexpectedly while trying to fix our stupid water pump (living in SW USA) and realized my skills weren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúlegendary.‚Äù Teddy failed. I failed. I ran. Wife understood, but I could see the disappoinent in her eyes. So, naturally, I think, ‚ÄúF-THIS‚Äù 
*Jumps through kitchen window; hoofs it to the tool shed* *Sets Teddy on the workbench, grabs tazer, duct tapes tazer to Teddy, wraps metal wiring from tazer around blade, activate tazer, Teddy lights up like a F‚Äôin Chrisas tree*
YEAH! *Heads back to water pump* Javelina is there, staring me in the GD face like a drunken frat kid. ‚ÄúOH, I‚ÄôLL COME AT YOU BRO‚Äù *Charges Javelina, Teddy sparks like a damn firework*
Wake up 3 days later in the hospital with a giant gash in my side. I see the blurry outline of my wife, ‚ÄúDid I get him?‚Äù Wife: ‚ÄúNo, he got away; the cops took your weapon.‚Äù I pass out again. 

Episode 6: After some time at the hospital, I come home, wrap some alcoholic gauze around my arm like thirty times, and I‚Äôm back to full strength.  Wife: ‚ÄúDid you hurt your arm too?‚Äù *Looks at gauzed up hand* Me: ‚ÄúI need more firepower.‚Äù *Looks at wife* Me: ‚ÄúHoney, do you trust me?‚Äù Wife: ‚ÄúNo! I absolutely do not trust your judgment right now. You just nearly died!‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúExactly! We need wheels.‚Äù *Grabs car keys, limps out the door* Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need more gauze.‚Äù 

Episode 7:  I return home with PigF$&%er, my sweet new buggy. I honk the horn in the driveway. I stand brandishing my recovered Teddy in all his glory and as my wife opens the door, I activate taze mode. Teddy lights up like a damn sword with a tazer attached to it. Wife: *closes door* 
I realize she‚Äôll only love me again if I kill this swine. *Buggy screeches out into the night* Experience Doubled.

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,12/2/2016,False,"TLDR - Interesting choices with city building, good graphics.  But AI and diplomacy is broken.

I like the city districts and the strategic possibilities it entails.  But it feels like they spent all their time on that mechanic.

Imagine being invited by a nation to help them fight a war, and then get denounced by the SAME country as a warmonger for your troubles.  Imagine getting suprised attacked by a nation, defending yourself and taking one of that nation's cities in retaliation and being denounced as a warmonger by that nation and everyone else.  Imagine liberating a nation long-dead for millennia, no acknowledgment of thanks, and then being denounced by the same liberated nation as a warmonger.  Welcome to Civ VI, where you are hated no matter what you do.  And no matter what victory condition you start with, you always end up wanting to nuke the &*$@#^& out of the nations around you.  For the first time in all the Civ games I've played I wished there was an option to execute opposing leaders, that's how annoyed I got.  Ah to see the eternally annoying Phillip II lose his head, now THAT would be fun...

Wait there's more!  Imagine being asked for a gift of resources, plus gold, plus gold per turn.  You think to yourself, ""I feel generous today"" and offer at least the resources and the one-time gold, but not the gold per turn.  Well, these entitled pricks will tell you, ""Not good enough!  We want a gift from you the way WE say it.""  It's unreal.  So back to nuking them.  Honestly I cannot understand the thinking that went into the diplomacy, it's the worst I've ever seen.  It doesn't just feel unfinished, it's plain bad.  As usual your opponents get to say snarky comments and threaten and bully you and you get no options to respond.  This has been an issue for me in previous games too, but it's even more exquistely painful in Civ VI.  

And the AI does ridiculous things like FLOOD your country with their missionaries and apostles, blocking your path and there's no option to even say, ""Hey, can you relax with the religion thing?""  I had to declare war multiple times just so I could move around my own empire.  And of course, the flood of hate and denouncing hits you from all sides.  I played king level and at the end of the game city states still had warriors and even some nations.  

This game needed way more playtesting.  I hope like other Civ games it improves with patches, but I'm not pre-ordering a Civ game ever again.",88102,1093,76561197968282800,1,60.90 hrs

552520,Far Cry 5,3/27/2018,True,"Spoiler free review.
It doesn't feel like a Far Cry game, while simultaniously feeling like a Far Cry game. In my opinion, this is how you proceed on with a franchise. Old mechanics that people didn't like were abandoned (and the game even makes a quip about one of them), and other ones are revamped in good ways.
Anyone who tells you that the game is a 'reskin' obviously hasn't taken a good look at this game. Ally NPCs that'll fight alongside you similar to games like Fallout, indepth gun customization revamped from Far Cry 4, an entirely new vehicle purchasing and customization system (not to mention the addition of planes and helicopters), full and proper map editor integration and revamp with a stupid amount of assets, a system where causing more chaos will have the main antagonists send things like recon helicopters out to try to find you when you're in their territory, a hidden stash system where you learn of the location of a cluster of goodies through word of mouth or recorded message... the game is different but in the best way possible. Whatever Ubisoft did this time, they couldn't have done it more right... except maybe add some more customization. Some areas are a bit lackluster.

People complain about graphics, but, to be honest, we're at a point where graphics getting better is starting to get a little much. It looks beautiful and fine as it is, minus a handful of oddly low-quality textures, but they're easily ignorable (and forgivable considering the game's environments)

Optimization is pretty good, however, the game seems to run the same no matter what settings I put it at. The only thing changing FPS drastically is making my FOV smaller, so if you have issues with FPS, lower your FOV if you're at something like 120.
* A new NVIDIA driver was just released that seems to give a decent bit of FPS, try that out too.

Progression feels pretty solid. Never felt pressured into buying into any of the microtransactions, so there's really no point to complain about them as they don't purposefully slow down progress or anything.

The game's aosphere is on point. Matched with the story, if you're someone who can easily get immersed into something, you'll find yourself easily falling into the game, especially at key scenes.

I have not run into nearly as many bugs as any negative reviews claim there is. I tried playing with my friend and I had a glitch where it just simply didn't respawn me, but that was about it. Any other bugs were ignorable.

Definitely an improvement from the previous games. As good, if not better, than Far Cry 3. I really hope this doesn't fall through the cracks because of stupid issues like 'b-but microtransactions!!!' or 'b-but it doesn't look better than real life!!!!' Another common argument against buying the game is the DRM associated, among other similar factors. All I can tell you is that you're missing out, and if you can find a way to get it without facing those issues, do it. (I've never been bothered by any sort of DRM, so purchasing it on Steam hasn't been a problem.)
I also have a little bit of a small bias - the fact that it takes place in the United States instead of a random country I'm not nearly familiar with makes the game a lot more attractive to me.",23849,2640,76561198008213400,19,60.12 hrs

648350,Jurassic World Evolution,6/15/2018,True,"[b] Please read this review and if you enjoy/agree give it a thumbs up because i REALLY want Frontier, the development team to see this or for people to possibly pass it on.[/b]
 This review will be rather detailed and in-depth and having unlocked all the island and put a good near 50 hours into the game as well as being a fan of the original Operation Genesis Park Building game there is alot to go through.

Before i get into the review do i recommend it? Yes i do, if you're a fan of Dinosaurs, Jurassic Park and the PS2 park game you will likely have an enjoyable  experience here too. If you're sitting on the fence or none of the former points made however, i honestly believe you should wait and save your money and see what changes take place in the coming months then go from there. Alot needs adjusting, trust me.

[h1]Positives[/h1]

+ [b]Dinosaur variation[/b]
 I have no complaints here and while there are many famous dinosaurs that are heavily requested such as the Quetzalcoatlus and the Dimetrodon i have hopes they will appear later in the game (though their appearance and mechanics will obviously have to be unique). As far as i'm aware the Developers have already confirmed marine life and flying reptiles in future content. There are over 40 dinosaurs with more coming next week and i won't even be able to have all these dinosaurs in the 5 islands i've completed, there's that many!

+ [b]Dinosaur Design[/b]
By this i mean the depth to dinosaur gene splicing. Variation in colour and stat designs is a nice, engaging and refreshing way to make dinosaurs stand out and add some layer of depth to personalising. For the most part dinosaurs also look great, with the expection being the Giganotasaurus and Spinosaurus being way too small in comparison to the T-Rex

+ [b]Music/Sound Design[/b]
The game takes music from the films and adds some of its own. All in all i have no complaints here in the slightest. The dinosaur sound effects and animations while walking and running is spot on. My only complaint here is that the Spinosaurus is missing its signature roar from the 3rd film, though perhaps they've simply made it more subtle. 

+ [b]Factions/Quests[/b]
While the factions are interesting and fun to play around with especially when you get sabotaged, i also enjoy the continious contracts and the progression itself. It might seem grindy to people new to the genre but i think they've done a good job here. Nothing stays gated for too long and alot of the more popular dinosaurs are open quite early. The faction quests themselves also introduce some new gameplay mechanics or encourage you to test things out.

+ [b]Services[/b]
The inclusion of the jeep and rework on the Helicopters in contrast to the original game is great. I love getting hands on and driving around the park even if i can't run over customers (this kills the immersion when you're trying to rush through the park avoiding customers to repair something ASAP during a storm). The upgrades that you can put on park facilities is also a nice inclusion.

+ [b]Research and Dig Panels[/b]
I like how much more deep the research panel is and what it has to offer! Great work here! There are alot more dig panels and it works pretty much the same as Genesis with abit more variation which i appreciate.

+ [b]Difficulty/World Design[/b]
The difficulty of the game could have an extra 'hardcore' option but for a first playthrough i'm finding it fun and entertaining, but once you learn mechanics and have played through the first 2-3 islands it becomes progressively easier.

The world design is appreciated. Now don't get me wrong, i really want to have an island that is completely open to me for me to piss around in, and while i feel the campaign islands SHOULD be restricted in size to force you to adapt and change your playstyle to keep things refreshing, i do also think the Sandbox Unlimited Resource zone is still just too small. I'd like the restrictions to end at the ocean, not confined within an area of the island. 

[h1]Negatives[/h1]

- [b]Customers and Visitors[/b]
If you've played Operation Genesis i'm sure you'll know where i'm coming from when i say how annoyed i felt when i realised there was literally no customer interaction at all. Having customers have unique personalities based upon their group (thrillseekers, passivists, dino nerds) added a nice layer to that game, and is something that is surely missing here. You also can't click on customers, know where they're from, what they think of the park or anything (Outside of the menu telling you). Another issues i have regarding customers that was in OG (operation genesis) is that they don't showcase items they've bought, or pull out umbrellas when it rains. THESE CHANGES will not be that difficult to implement i'm confident, and it would VASTLY add to the games fun and replayability as well as immersion. Please fix this ASAP!

- [b]A.I (Customers and Dinosaurs)[/b]
In a nutshell, the dinosaurs need alot of fine tuning and adjusents if not new features implemented. Dinosaurs don't sleep yet they have animations for being tranqualised? Why not add their ability to sleep or watch them take a shit and things that they would definetly do? Again, this isn't a big thing but would add depth to the game. Furthermore there is no pack hunting, no ""they do move in herds"" regarding herbivours outside of brief, repeated communications that all species do the same. 1v1 fights are fun but can they not be tweaked to have 2v1 or pack hunting encounters? Why do Herbivores end up killing more civilians when they run loose than Carnivores? Why do Carnivores constantly want to kill everything even when they arne't hungry, meaning i can't put multiple herbivoures and carnivores into the same enclosure because they're all suddenly the Indominus Rex in personality? Why do Raptors headbutt and break out of heavy steel fences instead of climbing over it like in JPOG? Why can't i run customers over in my vehicle? Why can't dinosaurs attack and destroy my vehicle? Why do customers keep making the same continious pointing gesture continiously every 4seconds? Why don't customers and dinosaurs get caught up in the Tornado or sent flying and killed? I swear they literally did NOTHING with the customers and ignored some very simple slice of life changes when it came to dinosaurs.

- [b]Park Features[/b]
They basically need to add more. The monorail...i mean i know what it does now but i can't click on it or i can't see customers sat inside the monorail as they tour the park, instead it's a black window, felt really lazy tbh. I can't see customers sitting inside the bar, customers just walk through walls and doors when enterting buildings? The customers looking through the viewing domes have no animation and just stand there (about 20 at a time which is also lazy and shows a lack of care in how it is presented). Like this stuff isn't even that big to implement! Please just put some time and care into the details! I assume the balloon ride and safarai park from OG will be implemented as DLC which is fine, but at least let us see a stat base window of how our strucutres are fairing, how our customers feel and let us attribute certain park attractions to attune to certain customer appeal! In the livestreams Frontier boasted about micro managment yet it's not that important outside of stocking up food supplies and managing storms and bad weather.


[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

In conclusion the game is a solid 7/10 but with some fine tuning, added features and more sim building mechanics and some minor graphic tweaks and some good A.I. tweaks and easier of life and immersion features i could definetly stick it up to an 8/10.. 

P.S.  Also a proper SITE B would be appreciated because the Sandbox Island doesn't feel the same!

Too many RPG aspects were cut. There was a clear focus on making the shooting mechanics better (which it was, I'll give them that), but a lack of attention towards role playing elements. 

There is almost too much to list.
1) Removal of skills
2) Perks becoming skills, instead of bonuses
3) Voiced protagonist
4) Protagonist's background is really well defined (wife, kid, served in the military)
5) Horrid writing, (as expected from post-Oblivion Bethesda)
6) Settlement mechanics are still broken and it's impossible to organize settlers without mods
7) Over-reliance on the modding community to make up for the game's short comings
8) Extremely vague dialogue option (>choose Sorry >character says ""Sorry that your daugther was too stupid to run, or something)

Regarding modding: Consider that (if you want to play without crashes), you're almost always required to get a Community Patch that fixes the game so Bethesda doesn't have to. Also, remember that at one point Bethesda and Steam began charging for mods, in which Bethesda would take over 75% of the profits.

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,11/27/2013,False,"Rome II has a few nice features the original Rome Total War lacked, like cavalry being able to dismount for assaults on cities ; and a battlefield AI which, after patching, is reasonably competent and doesn't throw it's generals in immediately to their deaths to try to run down a unit of skirmishers. Unfortunately it not only drops many of the most interesting, enjoyable and aosphere enhancing features that were in the original Rome, but also implements many features in ways that destroy game-play, believability and historical accuracy. It also seems unfinished

The province system in which cities are grouped into provinces in which buildings in one city affect every city in the province held by the same faction is interesting, but the way buildings work is pretty annoying.

You can research technology, but the starting tech isn't even bronze age - you need a tech advance for battering rams and ladders.

The level of detail you can see in your settlements population, happiness/unhappiness, squalor etc is massively reduced as is info on where income and trade income comes from.

The political system and 1 year turns result in generals being recalled or dying as soon as they get any significant experience or skills. Agents don't last much longer.

The stylised icon interface is annoying and not intuitive.

The AI and pathfinding bugs in assaults on walled cities are pretty terrible even after 6 patches and one beta patch. The AI still can't pick up, put down and use ladders, rams or siege towers effectively the way it could in the original Rome Total War ten years ago or Medieval 2 Total War 7 years ago.

There are over 100 factions, but many are out of period or just made up, including client states like Carthage's two ; and they slow the AI turn down more and more as the game progresses.

Worst of all are the instant super transports. Any army can create transports to carry it by stepping off a beach, for free. They're capable of fighting in sea battles and beating any starting fleet whether in auto-calc or not by weight of numbers. 

Every faction from Scythian nomad horse archers to Spanish and African tribes goes for a sail in the Mediterranean, with nothing much to fear from enemy navies. Factions which lose all their cities also take to the sea. They then either float there till they slowly die, or hover off the coast forcing you to place armies in all your coastal cities for dozens of turns until they slowly die of attrition, or else they take cities by avoiding your land armies and acting as vikings. What? Build fleets to hunt them down you say? But you can't afford to - ships for fleets take time and money to build and require pay. Instant transports don't - and your own field armies are tied down on land preventing them from coming back by sea.

Bizarrely the game designers have decided that transports should be just a slightly inferior version of a large oared warship with the same hundreds of oarsmen and ram and sleek design as a warship. In reality in the Roman and Hellenistic period transports were usually commandeered merchant sailing ships, because they could carry enough troops, horses and food and water for them. Oared warships were good for ramming, boarding and raking the oars off of enemy ships - but all those oarsmen and the narrow hulls to make them maneuverable left them with no room to carry more than a few marines. They usually followed coastlines so they could land to get food and water for the oarsmen each day - and so they could land if there was bad weather as oared galleys were not very seaworthy. Yet  insta-super-transports somehow  fit hundreds of soldiers, horses and elephants.

Unlike in the original Rome you can fight out sea battles rather than just autocalc them. The ships and marines in sea battles look great, but the way sea battles work is pretty lamentable. Boarding is made very easy. No need to use grapples (iron hooks on ropes) to get close to an enemy ship to board it, let alone use a corvus (rotatable boarding ramp with a spike on the end to go through the enemy deck) - bumping into them is good enough. Even more ridiculously, once one ship is boarding another no other ship or marines can touch either of them.

Historically smaller galleys could ouanouvre and defeat larger ships - as at the battle of Actium. In Rome II small ships are incapable of doing much damage to larger ones, even where the large ship is a transport or some lightly built viking style ship. Historically a small oared galley with a metal plated ram could turn faster than larger ships and immobilise them by oar raking (shearing off enemy ship's oars using ram). Or they could sink them by ramming broadside and holing it below the waterline. 

Many major ancient cities such as Syracuse and Jerusalem, which the Romans had great difficulty taking by siege and assault due to their massive fortifications and inner and outer walls and citadels are in the game as unwalled villages and hamlets. This makes the game even more ridiculous and annoying for anyone who knows even the basics of the history ‚Äì and makes no sense.
Total War games can‚Äôt include every settlement, so they usually include the most important, largest or most strategically significant ones. By conquering a settlement you conquered the province it was in in Rome Total War. In Rome II this is called the ‚Äòregion‚Äô with two or more regions grouped into a province. How could the most important settlement in an entire region be a hamlet or a village? Even ignoring the pissing all over history, this makes no sense.

Giving three quarters of settlements no walls seems like it was another cheap, rush option to minimise costs and so maximise profits. Have working siege AI? Nah - just re-use the engine from Empire, Napoleon and Shogun Total War but take the walls off most cities.

Some attempt to justify this as reducing the number of ""boring"" sieges / assaults. In fact it reduces the frequency and size of field battles compared to Rome 1 or Medieval 2 Total War because in those games the player or AI required at least 1 turn and usually more to build enough siege equipment to take a town - and in that time the player or AI usually sent an army to try to break the siege - resulting in a battle with the relieving army on one side and the besieging army and garrison on the other.

In Rome II you get lots of incredibly dull and annoying assaults on the unwalled town square against some garrison militia units instead. Field battles or assaults on an actual walled town using siege equipment would be preferable.

The myriad bugs a requiring endless patching and missing features suggest it was rushed out incomplete and without even beta testing.

Rome II runs poorly and with poor graphics on many PCs and laptops unless the Graphical Enhancement Mod is used. Mistakes made in the ongoing patching process make the game currently not run with mods. Anyone thinking of buying should hold off for at least 6 months and maybe a year or two till patching is over and better mods finished",54204,1304,76561198030916200,18,56.83 hrs

World is empty with very few destructables.
AI is awful, worse than ever.
Vehicle control is terrible, despite a driving dlc being released!
Submenus are direct console ports, merely changing tethers can mean 7 keypresses!

As you can see it's a long list of cons, many of which just are not acceptable in a $130 AUD AAA game from 2018/19.
The game randomly crashes and when the last patch came out many peoples saves were reset(including mine).
For reference i have an I7 6700k and 1080Ti, the game is so poorly optimised even i have problems.

The game doesn't even require you to liberate zones, you simply do a mission or a few of the (awful) side quests/stunts to level up your squad and unlock new zones.
This attempt at strategic JC gameplay can only be described as a ""risk the boardgame"" style strategy and fails hard.

The game is more a management sim with missions, not the interactive, die Hard, over the top movie like experience we have come to know and love about the Just Cause franchise.

Take it from someone who pre-ordered this as a HUGE fan of JC2 and 3, only to be let down by both the quality of the game and the lack of any real action by the developers.

The tech support of the forum goes unanswered for weeks at a time and for many people the game crashes regularly or resets their save games.

Buy it when its 75% off or avoid it entirely.

RIP Just Cause and shame on you SE.

262060,Darkest Dungeon¬Æ,1/19/2016,True,"TL;DR: Community Outrage Simulator masquerading as brutal dungeon crawl. 

10/10, would read a thousand angry, formerly-positive reviews about corrupt devs instead of playing a great game again.


I picked up DD over the summer, drawn in by a sociological interest in certain members of the ""community's"" outrageously toxic backlash to the implementation of corpses and some other changes. Obviously, I was familiar with and intruiged by DD for its excellent art style already, but generally I am the type to wait for something to be complete before I give it a shot. However the sea change from unabashed praise to seemingly universal criticism was so comically severe you'd have thought the game had actually reached out and harmed them.

So thank you, dear, angry, entitled, (imo) wrong-headed (but certainly allowed to have and express your opinion, which you most certainly do, oh yes, you do...) players, for without your concentrated, delerious ire I may not have discovered one of my favorite games of last (and now this) year! For me, everything about this game is a win. The art, animation, music, sound design, narration, and general presentation are all top-notch. The prose itself is a particular highlight, as is the tongue-in-cheek brutality and general tone. To me, they really nail it.

It's hard for me to address the criticisms leveled at the gameplay itself, because it seems to me the game is pretty straight forward about what it intends to be. DD is a procedurally-generated, turn-based dungeon crawler with an emphasis on difficulty (with reference to Dark Souls) and light RPG elements and squad-management (with reference to modern X-Com). 

I concede that this can be considered grindy. Dungeon crawlers are generally grindy, even great ones like Dungeon of the Endless or Legend of Grimrock. The distillation of the various aspects of the form, the massive selection of character classes, buffs, debuffs, monsters, the writing, the aesthetic, these come together to give it something more than the sum of its parts. However if you don't enjoy that core to some degree or other, I don't know why you'd be considering this anyway.

Personally, I never had a problem with corpses, because I never played the game without them. Over 50+ hours, I managed to beat a number of the bosses, level characters up to the top tiers, etc, ect, and only stopped because I felt like I had gotten far enough where I was ready to play the game in a finished state, and didn't want to master too much. I also died a lot. Then I died some more. And it was fun the whole time!

As the year went on and waves of negative Steam comments continued to roll in, I felt like I was inhabiting a completely different universe from those players. As they railed against it getting harder and harder, for example, I found myself reflecting that the game seemed to be being tweaked to make it easier. I certainly wasn't dying as much. Maybe I was just somehow very good at it? I don't know. I still die all the time in X-Com. I don't think of myself as a master gamer or tactician. 

The other critique I saw a lot, which is one that really prompted me to put my words out there in defense of this thing and those involved in crafting it, is that the devs somehow didn't care about the criticisms, that they don't listen, or that they were corrupt, or that they had abandoned the project like does actually occur in the Early Access community, that this game was somehow some kind of scam. That's just ridiculous. There were three major updates from the time of my purchace to the end of the year, which added all kinds of content in various ways. They were constantly tweaking the game to find the balance that worked. They were communicative, and they were clearly listening and being involved (and also making the game, for goodness sake, cmon). 

Getting back briefly to the Great Corpse Outrage 2k15, for example, corpses were made a voluntary opt-out in the options menu pretty much from Backlash Ground Zero. Not that a developer has any reason to do something like that, but to then deny that it happened, or to say that they don't listen, that they're somehow scamming you, that the game is ruined forever is just a hysterical, petulent, garbage argument. I can't understand what this aspect of the community actually wants, for the life of me. If the game isn't for you, you certainly don't have to play it. But a certain amount of the negativity (which borders on outright hostility) strikes me as being like that guy who orders and eats the burger and then complains to management it wasn't cooked to his liking. Still, you have to admire (if not boggle at) their conviction, and their sheer verbosity of it all.

For me, this game actually sold me on the idea that Early Access could be an enjoyable, worthwile process of participating in the honing of a project that you enjoy and want to support and I couldn't be happier with my decision to do so, and I look forward to playing it for another 50 hours or longer. Hopefully this small review will serve as some kind of counterpoint and let those bored few who got this far know that there's a worthy, enjoyable, wonderfully-crafted experience at the center of everyone's opining.",17111,1175,76561198169202500,9,55.00 hrs

About 4 Years ago, Sean Murray from Hello Games promised me giant Sandworms on the planets in the game he was making. It was promised in one of their pre-launch trailers. I bought the game after some deliberation, mostly because I wanted to see the giant Sandworms. They where my trigger, my selling point.

The game released. It was all a fiasco and a horrible mess. There where no worms, small or large. And the game was missing many other things. I still played it. After all I had some fun, and got some nice screenshots. But it was not what was promised. This was worming me deep inside since then. A feeling of betrayal and broken promises. I did not write a review back then.

Since back when I played the game on launch, it got many updates. I was surprised and liked what I saw on improvements over the years. But it was not enough to bring me back to the game, or heal the deep wound inside, even if the game got a lot better, and some of the broken promises got patched in.

But now No Man's Sky got its Origins Update to version 3.0
Now Sean Murray delivered to me what he promised me.

[b]GIANT SANDWORMS ARE ROAMING THE PLANETS OF NO MANS SKY![/b]

I will have to return to the game now, and watch the giant worms.

648350,Jurassic World Evolution,8/7/2018,False,"EDIT FOR PATCH: The patch addressed a large number of gameplay, graphical, and audio glithces and included a number of Quality-of-Life improvements which, while welcome, were minor with regards to changing this reviewer's opinion. The biggest addition to the game is the new ""Challenge Mode"" which provides additional incentive to become better (read: faster) at playing the game. While this will appeal to many players (I haven't yet tried it, myself, but I intend to), this doesn't alleviate some of the glaring flaws of my review, the lengthy original of which I'll leave intact below this.

The one gripe I had that was listed as addressed was the intensity at which every single carnivore murders whatever they can, and despite the patch notes stating things have been fixed, from a couple hours of testing they have been mildly improved but certainly not fixed. Carnivores now wait much longer to murder herbivores, which is great for an open ecosystem - with the exception of the Dilophosaurus, which gleefully butchers anything it can whenever it can (3 Dilophosauruses kill 6 hadrosaurs in less than 3 minutes). Carnivores are also only supposed to hunt now as dictated by their need for food, which by my testing isn't quite accurate; it seemed to work on some carnivores, and was entirely unaffected by hunger on others.

None of the rest of my review issues have been improved upon so... my recommendation stays the same: buy on sale, or don't buy. 

Original review: I paid full price on release for this game and was extremely excited for everything that was advertized. Make no mistake, this is one of the most visually stunning JP titles ever. However, that's mostly where the good impression ends.

I managed to ""beat"" the game in two weeks. In that time there was a good deal of frustration and annoyance, and in the end the unlimited open sandbox of Isla Nublar is neither unlimited nor open so I haven't bothered to play it much after the first day of completing the game.

The dinosaurs are advertised as ""intelligent."" They are anything but. Their requirements are finicky and they can't determine what side of their own compound they should stay on to remain happy. The pack hunters never hunt in packs. ALL the predators are murderous psychopaths that will kill any other dinosaur they can the moment they have access to it rather than for food, and the herbivores have absolutely zero herd mentality for protection. The game is glitched as well in which thirsty/starving dinosaurs cold be standing by a mound of food/lake of water and not consume it, preferring instead to simply die. The slightest disruption will send them into a concrete-wall-breaking frenzy (even the small ones that shouldn't even be able to crack the stuff) after which they all once again go murder-happy.

The ""quest"" system is equally nonsensical. Three factions that are SUPPOSED to be working together have the twitchiest, most ludicrous egotism in that when one succeeds at ANYTHING, the other two get... jealous? Really? And if you haven't paid enough attention to the poor divas they will actively sabotage the park causing the DEATHS of possibly hundreds of people at a time. Over a temper tantrum. Because you didn't take a photo for them of a dinosaur drinking, or you didn't release a dinosaur with a specific, low-level advantage. It breaks immersion immensely, considering those scientists, marketers, and security people should be outright shot, never mind arrested, for being responsible for that idiocy. None of the above system is actually enjoyable or realistic, and it's somehow heralded as this game's version of park management.

In response to those temper tantrums or weather effects, you need to keep your park safe. Instead of doing that intelligently, you need to instead prep yourself for more stupidity than any park owner should have to. Power's gone out? Well, your teams are suddenly on strike or something because YOU, YOURSELF need to hop into a jeep to turn all the power back on manually. While driving the jeep yourself is a fun addition, being forced to do it for basic continuance of the park (usually during a multiple-issue crisis) is a waste of time and again an unrealistic distraction from the gameplay. With regards to the weather, none of the dinosaurs seem at all comfortable in rain. Some will even bust out of the compound in a panic (maybe they're related to the wicked witch of the East or something), but once they've escaped the rain is forgotten because now there's human squeak-toys to munch on.

Finally there's the unlocking/advancement system. While I understand what the developers were trying to do, it's another unnecessary time sink that you stop what you're doing every THREE MINUTES to send out a dig team across the world for the barest of samples for study. Why are dig teams returning with only what fits in their pockets? Why are my dig teams not instead staying at dig sites, getting the fossils and then sending them back by mail continuously until they're done with the site? How much fuel and time is wasted going back and forth, and how much time is wasted by me leaving the main window to go to the world one and send them back out for the fifteenth time to the digsite they're so familiar with they should be paying rent to it? And if it's a money concern, how is it that I am the same person running the same company of the same park that has entirely different accounts for money on each of all these small islands?

The silly thing is a lot of these failings could be overlooked if the end result was really impressive, and it's not. The buildable area of Isla Nublar (the sandbox you can access partway through) is unfortunately VERY small considering all the dinosaurs you might want to populate it with and the visuals, while stunning, are still just more jungle. The island boasts no money necessary, but still has hatchery failure so the one major drawback to having a dinosaur fail in the real game isn't in place but instead creates a new one where you might want to create a dinosaur tough enough to stave off predators instead goes insane becuase it needs three in a herd to be happy but you've only successfully hatched one of fifteen attempts. Which brings me to another issue: there's no possible way to create an open ecosystem. The predators are entirely psychopathic, and the herbivores are idiots. The carnivores will attack anyting they can because they exist, and will even impale themselves upon a Triceratops's horns because they have nothing better to attack. The herding animals will wander AWAY from each other, then get upset because tere aren't enough of them nearby even though they're the ones that wandered off. Conversely, an anti-social dinosaur (even the herding ones) will know instinctively how many dinosaurs are in even an extremely large enclosure and get upset about overpopulation, even as they get upset that they are alone in the one corner of the pen while the other three are in the other corner.

To sum up: this game has so much POTENTIAL but failed to deliver upon launch. It currently does not have the staying power and draw that other sandbox games do, while having some of the best features of a sandbox game (dinosaurs, naturally, but also the ability to drive a jeep, fly a helicopter, and use a Gyrosphere in the park alongside the guests). There are some really well-done moments (a pack of four or five Dilophosauruses being ""social"" by chatting and chirping among themselves and flicking their wrists is the most adorable thing in the game), which are overshadowed by things that are more frustrations and roadblocks than actual gameplay and content.

I might recommend this game when it goes on sale, considering there are now mods to help out with some of the failings. However, as someone who is not usually a ""mod"" guy, I have to give this one a pass at full price. A game at this cost and with this IP has a relatively high bar to hit, and clearly failed.",2884,1807,76561198038222500,2,52.90 hrs

-------------------------------------------------

Some small part of me really hoped that Bethesda would have learned their lessons following the recent abyssmal series of failures they have created for themselves in the recent past such as the paid mods push for Skyrim, their tendency to controversially sue any and all games (& indie developers) that have fallout in their name (see Fortress Fallout), their decisions to release versions of games they know full well are broken (see Skyrim for PS3 & Fallout: New Vegas for all systems) and their line of colossal failure titles (Rage, Elder scrolls online, Brink)..

But.. Nope. They keep the tradition of idiocy rolling stronger than ever before this game was even released by ruthlessly hunting down and banning & blocking & t-bagging & suing any and all people who shared as much as a screenshot of Fallout 4 outside the official trailers before the game had been released globally for everyone (Owners of review copies & people in Germany literally got burned at the stake). They even went as far as to force Steam to ruthlessly hunt down and ban & permanently shut down ANY Steam accounts that tried reducing the incredibly unfairly made store set timer by changing their country of origin to access the product they've bought a few hours faster as friends in other countries were playing it. I'm not even kidding, this happened to HUNDREDS of people: http://i.imgur.com/TjEObhD.png

Witnessing all of this in real time as I was myself waiting for my copy to ""unlock"", I couldn't help but to stop and ponder in fright as to just why they would choose to act out in these levels of r√®tardation.. Was there some incredibly dirty secret they were oh so desperately trying to shovel under the rug? Was there in fact only a small tutorial area for Fallout 4 and nothing else beyond that? I kept making theories until I decided that It was enough guessing and I took to the Internet to download the illegal child-porn r√†pe equal that was the two hour stream ""gameplay leak"" video from my local P2P website, I sat down and calmly watched through it. After two hours, I went ""What the f*ck is all the fuzz about this?"", as the entire video was the guy doing the starting area and little to nothing else with only a few very minor bugs happening for him.

Dumbfonded over their actions at this point, I pulled some strings with a few contacts of mine and got myself the release version of the game early for me to play. I spent some time making a solid spec that could handle me going Survivalist at square one and at this point in time, I have played this game for about 80 hours.. And all I can say is: ""Bethesda, You dun' f√πcked up.""

------------------------------------------------------------------

Fallout 4 is a mind-boggingly catastrophic failure through both a design perspective and on a purely technological level with a shockingly large amount of reports being posted on the Steam forums (and elsewhere) of startup crashes, program hang-ups, dialog freezing, audio cutting, black screens, micro stuttering, pixel distortions, missing audio, disk writing errors, memory leaks, screen flickering, freezing UI, crashing drivers, broken mouse & keyboard inputs, horrid performance for pcs both above and below recommended specs, broken aspect ratios & resolutions and the list just goes on and on for over 200 pages on the Steam forums.

""What about the design then?"" you ask? Facepalms everywhere here as well I'm afraid. To simplify things, I'm gonna list some of them off:


1. The graphics. Going along with the flat-out lying that Bethesda has made about the FPS & resolution not being capped for the PC when they both are ( http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-4-resolution-and-frame-rate-wont-be-limited-on-pc/ ), you also have a game that is incredibly ugly for It's time with It's lack of detail only managing to work against itself as guns are as of right now, all wrongly represented. Aim down your sights over some cover? You're gonna hit the cover instead of your enemy. Why? Because all shots originate from an angle that is around the player's torso instead from the barrel of the gun you're shooting. Wanted to play the game in third person and have your character use a gun? Good luck. It's about 25 times worse there, especially at close distances.


2. The dialogue system. Ripping off Mass Effect.. I mean, REALLY BETHESDA? Before, you had the choice from an often vivid list of possible dialogues with friendly (and not so friendly) NPC's that always managed to keep you intruiged with what they had to say. It often rewarded you for being a good listener and If you happened to have any particular set of skills to help a situation you were conversing about, you could jump in and show off. Other times, you would just indiscriminately stumble into interesting characters that you could have hilarious dialog with and no matter how many times you re-played the game, It would still be just as funny as the first time.

In Fallout 4, this has ALL BEEN REMOVED and replaced with (99.9% of the time), and I sh√¨t you not now:

a) Sarcasm/More info
b) Maybe
c) Yes
d) No

They are uninformative as all hell as to just what your character is going to say when you pick them (Exact same problem from Mass Effect) and they are all depending on the voice-actors to add some flavor to conversations being had in the game when the script is the embodiment with that of a dead, farting camel. You may be surprised by the smell but once you take a good look on what you're indulging in, you get the strongest of urge to back off as fast as possible without ever looking back. It can also be argued for that the addition of the protagonist being fully voiced only helps to damage what little chance of immersion there was left to have in this game as no matter what the player does, he will remain to be the same, stereotypical ""Hurr durr, i do dis fur my familie"" guy. 

To sum it up: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=551675456


3. The difficulty settings. This is easiest one of my biggest personal complaints. The game has a variety of difficulty settings which you can change at any time and It starts off at normal, going up to hard, very hard and then finally to Survivalist which is the hardest of them all. What does this Survivalist difficulty do? Reduce the speed of how fast your health regenerates from healing items and amps up the HP & damage for all enemies. That's it. It is the most disgusting display of pure artifical difficulty I have EVER encountered in a game that gives itself the audacity to be called a ""New release"" in the year 2015. There are literally THOUSANDS of things Bethesda could have done to integrate a much more interactive & fun way to challenge players (rather than just slapping 50000 extra health & damage on every single creature) such as a more fleshed out medical/healing system ( For example, how awesome wouldn't this be to have: https://youtu.be/5JpQ401QVlA?t=1m28s ) but instead, everything has been depressingly dumbed down to three items. Food for HP, Stimpacks for damaged limbs and Radaway for radiation. That's it. Know those three and you're a head chief surgeon for life in Fallout 4.


4. Progression. Last point ill make due to text limitations, The way they have handled character progression in this game is downright grotesque. Want to specialize or progress on your own terms using perks? Too bad, play like everyone else and wait for the stated levels to become better/unlock that specific thing. Next to ALL of the perks in this game have their second perk level be locked behind level 17+ which is just absurd as you can average level 8-10~ after 4-5 hours of play.

Like many others have said, this game has a load of potential to be absolutely awesome. I'm not complaining about figuring how everything works - I enjoy doing that. However, it is painfully obvious that the QA for this game was either non-existent, or done by a llama. 

complaints 

1. The most annoying thing by far is colonist job allocation. It's a horrendously tedious task to recount how many scientists you have every 20 minutes when one becomes a senior and messes with the equilibrium of jobs in your dome. Oh, wait, that's only for one dome. When you have 3-4 it is absolutely impossible to manage jobs until you get enough resources to efficiently specialize domes for specific specialists. However, it takes HOURS of absolutely mind-numbing micromanagement to get to this point. 

2. Please for the love of god let me queue up multiple actions with my rovers. The micromanaging makes surveying a pain. 

3. When setting up a trade route with the hauler, why can't the hauler auto-recharge its battery, and maintain the trade route...? That seems like common sense, because setting up the same exact trade route 15 times over the course of a game is fairly stupid. 

4. Why are all of the notifications the same size? Why am I reminded constantly that buildings aren't working, when they simply are full? Looking at you, concrete.

5. The map feels okay at first, but why does it minimize my colony overview whenever I open it?

6. Drone allocation is a paaaaai... just kidding. People keep bringing up drone allocation but the prefab buttons on the hubs make reallocating drones fairly easy

7. Was there QA for this game?

TLDR: Daaaaaaang the UI is bad. Some of the mechanics with colonists are also terrible. 

Positives?

Graphics are neat. 
The mysteries/missions are cool, story seems to progress at a decent pace as well. 
Building is very easy and straightforward once you play with it a little.
Resource management is always on your mind, which is something I like in base builder games.

Overall?

Most of the ideas behind the content is awesome, and the execution with many things is done very well, but then.. there's the UI. It honestly ruins the experience completely.

I'd recommend not to buy this game until they patch these issues, it's not worth the frustration.


QUICK EDIT DUE TO MESSAGES:

People are leaving negative reviews because the game should not have been launched at all. There are serious issues with mechanics and UI functionality that make this game frustrating instead of fun for many, many people. 

We can't become complacent with game devs when it comes to releasing unfinished work. It's painfully obvious that's what they did with this game, and encouraging others to buy this game by 'recommending,' despite all of its issues, is just fueling the fire. 

So yeah, I don't recommend buying this game. It's not done. They may or may not finish it with a patch, but I'm not misleading anyone.

    The game introduces a new mechanic called ""Glory Kills"" basically demons that are staggered can be killed in spectacular fashion, that as well as the challenges, collectibles and secrets through out the levels will have you searching all over for the hidden levels from the original DOOM, this and the large amount of levels combined leads up to atleast 11-14 hours of gameplay. The levels in DOOM are great in the fact that most of them aren't linear, unlike most FPS games.

Although the AI can be a bit dumb at times, sometimes getting stuck somewhere or being a bit slow in some sections, nothing too serious though. The gameplay may also get repetitive at times.

[h1] STORY [/h1]
     Believe it or not this game does have a story, while the story may seem a bit drab or boring to you at first it gets much better later on in the game, as the story will suprisingly hold your attention and is quite interesting once you understand it, my problem though is that the story ended a bit, sudden as it seemed it was only to set up the base for a second game or maybe DLC. 

[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]
      DOOM(2016) is a beautiful game, the graphics engine and the lighting give a wonderful aosphere to the game, especially in Hell. The glow and other visual effects make the game look beautiful. Another plus is that it is very well optimized, I could run it at Ultra just around the specs required at a near steady 60FPS.

[h1] AUDIO AND MUSIC [/h1]
     The music in DOOM is amazing in the fact of how well it fits the levels and combat. The little solos you hear every time you commence a glory kill make the game feel dynamic with the music, Mick Gordon delivered his music and he did so perfectly. 
     The weapons all sound like they have force in them, leading for more fun and immersive gameplay, the sound of minigun bullets tearing through the flesh of a Hell Knight is so satisfying.

[h1] MULTIPLAYER [/h1]
     From what I heard the multiplayer in the Beta was bad, but I'm glad to tell you thats simply not the case anymore. The multiplayer in DOOM (2016) is very fun, with all the different unlocks and vast amount of freedom you have on how you customize your marine for combat. Player progression feels fair and fun as you level up fairly quickly early on. That with the large amount of game modes and maps make the multiplayer very fun.

A large part of the multiplayer is playing as the demons themselves, being incredibly powerful and killing most players in a few hits, forcing players to work together to bring down the beast, or run. The coolest part is you can choose which demon you get to be when you do become that Demon.

   Another large aspect of the multiplayer is SNAPMAP, a tool for anyone in the community to easily make their own levels with lots of freedom on how to do so. There are tons of player made missions, I've played a few myself they are very fun and I reccommend you check it out.

[h1] OVERALL [/h1]
All together DOOM (2016) is a fantastic game that is full of replay value just to get the achievements and secrets throughout the levels, that with the massive amount of content from the multiplayer may have you playing for a while! 
All in all I give DOOM(2016) a [h1] 9/10 [/h1] the fantastic visuals and music along with the gameplay make this game an amazing experience!",51821,1021,76561198021354200,8,51.20 hrs

377160,Fallout 4,11/10/2015,False,"Where to begin. I guess we'll start with the fact that the rpg elements of decent dialogue and immersion are thrown out the window. Any attempts to develop a role or persona or any semblence of choice in this ""rpg"" are gone. 

The dialogue options have been streamlined to the point that you essentially have no way of branching or expanding the story. The dialogue is laughably terrible compared to the previous 2 games of the series. 

Additionally, the dialogue choices are vague, and offer the eloquent and lovely choices:

Yes
No
Sarcastic
<insert vague question that is usually one word and is in no way helpful or what you meant to ask>

These choices are what you are dealt 90% of the time. I'm serious. 

The voice actor rarely even says remotely what you choose. don't get me started on how lack luster he is as a character. 

The Character Creation System is superb, though the whole point of a creation system is moot if everyones character talks, acts, and from a role playing stance is the same as everyone else. 

The map size is fairly small compared to other AAA titles with open world exploration. The map can be traversed in 11 minutes. 


The new power armor mechanic is interesting, but misguided. I enjoy the customization quite a bit. It truly is a fantastic start, but power armor is now functionally a vehicle you need to fuel constantly. Having to refuel and find fuel cells constantly is irritating at best and I feel makes power armor less enjoyable.

The construction system is laughable, many of the building items hover in the air above the ground as if they havent been tested on uneven terrain. The weapon creation system is interesting, but spams loot into your inventory that you cant consolidate.

The perk tree and special system is oversimplified. Perks in many branches are worthless. Skills like medicine, repair, and science are virtually non existent. forget about using well advanced skills to solve problems creatively.

For example: charisma is now the skill of ""wave gun at x to pacify it"" instead of being focused on persuasion. Because you know, waving a gun like a raving lunatic is super charismatic. 

Intelligence is used only for crafting, terminals and additional experience. 

Intelligence and charisma or any skill no longer offer unique dialogue choices. The traditional system has been replaced with a shit colour spectrum system hovering over one of the always 4 dialogue options. 

Interestingly enough, even perks like ""Lady Killer"" (there is no confirmed bachelor) have had their dialogue options removed. What's the fun in that? Nobody chooses perks like that for the damage, Bethesda. Just another shameful consequence of not allowing a vast dialogue for the player to explore.

you basically get your own faction after 2 quests. holy shit if only running a faction did anything. 

The game's story is super bland. I wont spoil this early, but seriously, who didnt see that coming? 

Even Stevie Wonder saw that shit a mile away.

The combat is incredibly smooth, I'll give it that. The combat isn't typically what I personally care about in a RPG, but Fallout 4 does that well. 

It's a shame that they are incorporating a lot of mechanics that the casual market is adopting. It isn't necesarily a bad thing, but it demonstrates the angle they are going for. Casual. 

In terms of graphics, I'll make some concessions. I did not anticipate great visuals. I had hoped the usual stellar story and decision making aosphere would carry the game. 

I was dissapointed.

As someone who has played every fallout game in the past, and loved the series I'm not quite sure this can be considered a proper Fallout title. 

Todd Howard lies again. Just like oblivion, just like fallout 3. We fell for it.

Update: I wanted to speak about companions. It's great you can send them to different locations when dismissing, but I do miss being able to stop and ask them their life story. Interesting companions with their own stories to tell gave the previous games some depth that I'm currently missing. They do have personal missions, however any attempts to learn about them outside of these events is impossible thanks to a lack of dialogue.

Additionally, It seems companions have a peculiar system of dislikes and likes. Piper seems to get excited any time you loot something, and Strong gets angry at you everytime you step foot into power armor. Are we expected to avoid a staple of combat in his presence?  

oh, and be mindful about their location. I sent dogmeat to sanctuary and he just randomly hides in one of the random doghouses. It's sometimes a pain to find his flea bitten ass.

The absence of the Karma system has been sad as well, but at least we have the companions' relationship status. It isnt a system I'm happy with, but at least it's there.

another update: still no sign of any type of uses for medicine, repair, or a science skill to solve an issue. It looks like there isnt even a repair or science skill other than the perks for weapons crafting. I used to enjoy unique solutions to quests using these skills. 

example of what is missing: In new vegas, you used to have options that would affect the narrative of a quest assuming you had a certain skill high enough. (repair 35 to fix ""x"" or medicine of 100 to identify this issue with this NPC)

update: remembered that critical hits are no longer calculated based on random RNG and can instead be stored. I can't say I'm a fan of changing the luck mechanic.

note: to the people complaining on how many games are in this series. I am aware of the number of titles. The phrase "" the previous 2 games of the series. "" means that compared to the last two iterations of the series. It does not state there are only two previous games. I can't believe I have to clarify this. LeVar Burton is dissapointed.

after about 20hrs fallout is crashing on load of a save

final update: All four of the endings are absurdly generic. The ending cutscene no longer details the ramifications of your choices, but instead ends similar to Mass Effect. The ending cutscene does not change and is static regardless.",98042,1719,76561198099642700,3,50.78 hrs

814380,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,3/27/2019,True,"Sekiro is not a Souls game. This can't be stressed enough. Attempt to i-frame dodge through the game and you will get your ass slapped all the way back to Lordran. While it borrows certain elements from Souls, like the checkpoint system or cryptic NPC questlines, it's pretty much its own beast. And what a beast it is. 

It's one of those good news, bad news situations. Good news: the days when you needed to keep an eye on your stamina for every attack, block or dodge are over. Bad news: that doesn't mean the game is any less challenging. Quite the opposite, actually. Wolfie goes down in two hits tops, and at all times he's either heavily outnumbered or he gets crushed in the health bar measuring contest. And the absence of stats, gear and online co-op means there are no shortcuts. You won't be able to overlevel, no Solaire will come to your aid. It's either nut up or shut up.

Luckily, there are ways to put you at a lesser disadvantage. Sekiro features a rudimentary stealth system and enough freedom to thin out your enemies' ranks one by one. Most of the times you can clear entire areas just by being sneaky. Apparently, Sekiro started out as a Tenchu game and I totally believe it, considering how far stealth will get you. But eventually a direct confrontation will be unavoidable. And where Souls games required you to only land that one parry, Sekiro demands that you time your blocks near perfectly several times per exchange. Combat is fast, fluid and demanding enough to make you break a sweat.

While the areas are open and generally well-designed, they are not exactly eyecandy. Souls games are known for their sinister beauty, but that is largely absent in Sekiro. Some areas look flat-out rough. Only rarely will you get the urge to stop and soak in the aosphere. A missed opportunity, really. And while the environments leave room for exploration, the absence of cool gear makes it feel strangely unrewarding. Also, due to the nature of combat you will see the same instakill moves and finishers quite often. A bit of variety would have been nice.

Like the player, Sekiro faces its own set of challenges. Developer From Software has been around for over three decades, but only since the release of Demon's Souls the studio has gained a larger recognition in the West. Ever since, most of their games have been Souls games either directly or in spirit. Being widely known as the developer of Souls games came with the issue that they were expected to make nothing but Souls games - a curse, if you will. Sekiro marks the first time in a while that a major From Software title branches out far enough to be called its own thing - and be accepted by a large audience. With that leap of faith out of the way, it'll be exciting to see what they will come up with next.",58125,1365,76561198009772000,24,49.92 hrs

[b]Storyline - 10/10 [/b]
Story is presented in a very nice form. In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. We can do it quietly or killing everyone. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. The story is for 30h game without sidequests. We also have mini games like cards (Gwent).

[b]Gameplay - 9/10 [/b]
Beautiful world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore caves, forests, mountains, helping peoples and doing much more things. The map is 30 times bigger than in the previous part. Crafting and Alchemy are more important, we also can upgrade swords, armors and signs. These sandbox gives many, many opportunities. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.

[b]Characters - 10/10 [/b]
Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can decide who will be our enemy and who is our friend. We also can choose the path of the main character. Character (mainly Geralt's) and monsters doing really great feeling, details are amazing.

[b]Graphics - 10/10 [/b]
Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water clouds are very well refined, falling leaves, changing weather make a huge impression.

Music and ambient sounds in this game is great fits. We can listen medieval music which is selected for each moment of the game. Animals noises are natural. The monsters sounds are really threatening. Character voices are well selected and fit into personalities.

285190,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III",4/27/2017,False,"I loved the first Dawn of War. I played it as an semi/e-sport and i've spent years on it since the day one, clocking in more than 1400hrs before the Steam release. I didn't like DoW 2 like the first one but i admit the campaign was amazing, one of the most entertaining i've ever playd in a RTS.

What can i say about DoW 3? I don't know. I was really hyped about it and i may be biased towards Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, but it's a disappoinent.
The campaign is linear, very Starcraft like, the story - except for few fragments which i'm not gonna spoil - is kinda boring. Most of the missions are slow and seems made just to introduce people to the multiplayer. Still, even if you can't customize a thing, it's Warhammer 40.000. Not counting the backflipping space marines and the death-spinning goofy orks.

And the multiplayer? Woah. The clearly forced it to be an esports game, by limiting themselves and limiting the fun of the game.
There is only [b]one single mode[/b], which is inspired by DOTA: a core for every faction and few towers defending it. To destroy the towers - and the core - you need to destroy a shield generator first.
The maps also have [b]lanes[/b] (2-3 lanes depending on the number of players) and bushes, and are ALL mirrored and VERY small. Eldar can't stealth their structures, you can't relocate your HQ or build another one, you can't rush (who remember the Tau Rush?). It's not a strategy game, i admit is ""different"". But ""different"" doesn't always mean ""better"". Every game ends in being slow and repetitive.

Sure, you can customize your army with three elite units and six doctrines. Too bad that also the most characteristics units of a faction are elite units. And you can't have more than one of them. 
This way strategies are very limited and armies feel pretty much the same. Yeah they have a exclusive gimmick, like the orks being able to power up and the speed buff of the Eldars, but that's all. The [b]core roster of units is pretty much the same[/b], role speaking. I miss being able to launch a bunch of Terminators squad in the enemy formations or doing skirmishes strategies with 40+ warp spiders. Heck, even Stormboyz are considered Elite.
Of course you have to slowly grind to get all the Elites. They cost 200-300 ea and you get 2040 skulls for completing the campaign (Hard).

And when Escalation II starts? [h1]""Welcome to the Blob Wars!""[/h1]

You can still build some structures (no defenses though) but it's pretty much everything dumbed down. There is no cover system, heroes have less abilities, UI is a mess.
And If you're looking into this game because you loved doing skirmish annihilations with friends against the AI, stop. There is none. The skirmish is the same MOBA-like mode, with the same limits about elites and a stupid-as-fuck AI.

It's really a shame to see that the new Relic tried to make a game for a different fanbase from what they gathered in the past years. Probably - in its semplicity - it will be enjoyable for the new fanbase, for me it's just depressing to see my favorite series stripped down of its most interesting features.

I'll probably enjoy more when they're gonna add some classic RTS modes (or when me - or any other modder - will be able to create a LARGE map without towers and other bullshit)


[b] EDIT, READ THIS [/b]:
Guys, as i said in the review. This game is not total crap, is just a new simplicistic - and dull - approach to the RTS genre. Maybe it's a good starting point for someone who's doesn't know how to play RTS and is new to the genre or to Warhammer lore, but to me is just too stupid. 

Is like a child between LoL and Starcraft (with no offense for Starcraft 2). 

""I'm too old for this shit"". 

I don't want the game to fail but i do want to let the new devs that Dawn of War was ""more"" than this. That there is a need of other modes and of a true skirmish coop capped at 8 players, with more than two teams (you can't do 2v2v2). Yes, if something is different doesn't mean is bad either, but this isn't innovating, this is removing features from a established series. That's why i can't recommend it (it also has no content).

So yeah, keep it civil and read it trough.

Reminder to the devs: Counter Strike and Starcraft are the most played e-sports ever and they weren't build with e-sport in mind. Don't force ""e-sport"" mechanics in a game by making it dull.

252490,Rust,6/9/2016,False,"The issue I have with the game, is by far, its community.

DISCLAIMER: This review is old, and as such does not reflect the game in its current state. I have been notified that apparently substantial changes have been made to the game. These changes might have fixed a lot of the issues that were inherent ot Rust, especially community based ones. But I myself am unable to confirm this as University and studies are taking up more and more of my time and as such i am unable to actually recheck any of my above statements.

PROS:

-Intense survival experience, you are a mortal in a dangerous world

- Initially cold, hunger and thirst are real threats.

- The graphics can be very pretty, if you can run them.

- Sounds are nice, gun shots ring out and pierce the still air.

- Building is interesting and fun.

- exploration is interesting and the blueprint system is pretty fun.

CONS:

- The community tends to be absolute garbage *Expanded at the bottom*

- Servers tend to be immediatly taken over by massive constuctions, and sometimes clans immediatly dominate.

- Resources become scarce pretty damn quickly

- Animals run up sheer cliffs and can be quite glitchy

- No costomizability *this is very minor*

- KOS; COD style.

-Optimization, my decent rig constantly overheats if I don't put my fans into hyperdrive; manually.


NOW TO EXPLAIN: The community is simply cancer. If you are neaked and a geared trooper sees you, you can almost bet that he is going to shoot you for no reason. The excuse is; this is PVP, and that you ar a potential danger, or even ""Just like in real life"" 

     Well here is the issue, KOS is not very real life, BUT the game is silent, it is dead when you move around. The only thing to break the silence is gunshots, some screeming from what is usually a poor helpless naked that has just barely managed to get his 2.5k wood to start his shack. Even when he makes his shack, instead of negotiating forming an alliance, this player is eliminated, his base raided for little to no resources and as such he has to start all over and the raider gets the thrill of raiding an offline 2 by 2 shack. This is all due to a KOS mentality that is so far from survival mentality that it is in reality COD mentality. The game runs like this:

1) Spawn, get materials build a small base
2) get blueprints and start gettign ready to wreck some anus
3) establish dominance in your area
4) Once dominance is established with your little posse build a massive unraidable castle
5) dominate the area and consume all resources, killing anyone you see for the fun of it, because you are now bored. 
6) Make four excuses : ""Git Gud"" , ""Become like us"" , ""Everyone is a threat, therefore I can KOS because I feel like it"" , ""Man salty nakeds"" 

I once managed to get a small group going, immediatly a small but well armed clan emerged from their base and began hunting nakeds, just because. We had just managed to make a bow for one of us, when they emerged from the trees and just sprayed into us, killing all 5, and screaming through their mics that we suck and to ""git Gud"". This behaviour has slowly but surely been spreading throughout the entire community because it is the best way to play. Kill everyone, steal their resources, build yourself. It's also pointless. It makes the game a ghost town. Not but one year ago the servers were full of new players. Now the servers I usually play on barely peak over 1/2 the population, most of those being either clans or KOS' ers. 

     It is sad to see such a great game go to waste because of the community, the only break from this is RP servers and PVE servers. RP servers maintain that PVP aspect, but give it a nice twist where KOS is rerely an option as each side has quite a lot to loose and tensions get higher than ever, whereas with KOS its usually just a naked dropping dead every so often. Sometimes clans will clash and then everything looks great. But those occurences are rare. 

     The community needs to change if the game is going to ever survive, and in fact, thrive. I would suggest implementing a system like unturned has. You cannot hide weapons in your quickbar, either you have a tool to quick draw or a weapon, and then everyone can see how well armed you are, as well as add some strategic depth to the game. Also make nature more intense, make the PVE aspect even more challanging, its apparently post nuclear time, some strange shit ought to be walking around. It would add a nice threat to well geared players and well give nakeds a nicer start as they are suddenly not the primary target for shits and giggles. There also needs to be benefits to living a peaceful life, and benefits to living a violent one, and each needs its downsides. Right now violence is the only solution, pitifully so. Your chances of going out and finding a place to survive peacefully is nigh impossible (This is vital as you have no means to fight back effectively unless you are a god at PVP, you need time and space to build up otherwise clans are mandatory or just a willingness to grind and be online 24/7). Especially when these massive bases make their rise. The only person rading such a base is another person with a similar base, and even then they will probably fail, and require a clan. KOS is simply not beneficial in any way, and it is in fact detrimental. It simply takes away any real purpose in playing solo, and in fact makes random encounters and random party forming... impossible. KOS should remain firmly in the realm of FPS shooters, COD and Battlefield. Not survival games where you shoot at non threats because you have hit endgame and need someone to plink at. 

     The game needs to change, and minor changes are needed. But as it stands I would not recommend the game. An amazing idea ruined by a terribly toxic community. Maybe ill come back to it next year.  --> NOTE: No I havent don't have time.

EDIT: Basically this review is beyond old, i put the damn disclaimer in. Additionally now that it has been years since I have played but I have managed to watch some playthroughs of random people, stimpee is one example go sub to the man, the issue of the game and many like it seems to be that the game lacks a real PVE aspect where the enviorment is any threat at all. Sure you get helicopters and now player placed turrets and guards, but thats really a null threat in the end as you get better, and generally they can be avoided. But there were ideas early on to make the world truly threatening and even terrifying. This makes all raides a double gambit. Imagine if firing guns causes some kind of mechanical construct to come to the area eventually. Or mutated animated stone or something. The sky is the limit. But it would mean that all PVP actions are bringing to the game extra content. In a way this means that areas ""dominated"" by players will become high tier areas. There is huge threat there, and there is also huge payoff there with additional end game content and items and challanges. This then frees up areas around the region for people to build up and deters nakeds from entering this area. As said before a lack of ability to hide your items is also very important. It means that when you are raiding, you are raiding. When you are mining, you are mining. When you are armed... you are armed and everyone knows it.

This game is far from being bad, it is a great game but it constantly pushes you toward spending money. Upgrading items costs resources, upgrading your ship costs resources and at no time does it ever feel good to be in a shop looking at your choices when you know that this choice wouldn't exist if you payed more money. Being able to pay for something undermines any purpose the resources have by boiling them all down to ""you could farm this stuff but we would really rather you just pay us more"" because no matter how much they give you during play you still know that it was all put into the game with the intent of giving you something you could spend real money on. If you couldn't buy them then it would make said resources and levels you gain feel purposful, if you ever want to prove this point to yourself simply imagine your favorite games with a similar cash store being added in, imagine any final fantasy game where you could buy EXP or cash boosts, imagine Pacman if you could get a 2xpoints boost for 1.99$ and how that would literally make everything you do feel undermined.",43630,1182,76561198026813400,57,48.62 hrs

Problems
-Humans are not really even a factor in game like they were in JPOG a game that came out 15 years ago...  Need more interaction / individual person stats etc. 
-No first person veiws from the viewing stands like the OG game... but there are in Gyrospheres? 
- When you tranq a dino it sleeps until it is transported or it starves to death, make it so the tranq is time based instead... 
-AI is not that great Ranger Jeeps ramming off gates and driving through crowds at top speeds.
-The 3 factions fighting for your attention but are all from the same company? Ballance these to not conflict as much, like picking a tech tree instead of babysitting. 
-Dinos can only fight 1v1 please make dinos that had pack behaviors be able to function in packs and fight 3v1 etc.... 
-Small Maps, I understand that the story line maps are built to the sizes needed, but the sandbox needs to be a LOT bigger. 
- No decorations / customization, give us benches, trashcans, hotdog stands, and most importantly some Jurassic Park buildings for retro builds. 


***Bonus***
PLEASE make size a factor in the DNA mods, then make all the dinos their real sizes and we can adust how big we want them in our parks. (Maybe a 5-10% variation with an option to go larger or smaller)

377160,Fallout 4,11/12/2015,True,"[b]Recommended with Caution!!![/b] 

UPDATED : 18/11/2015, Additions and edits are in [i]italics[/i]

Incoming wall of glorious text.

[h1]TL:DR[/h1]

Fallout 4 is a welcome addition to the franchise but suffers greatly by ""over-extending"" itself, which results in a more simplified gaming experience as opposed to the previous (Fallout 3/New Vegas) installments. Gunplay is more fast paced but SOME RPG elements have been stripped down. The new game mechanics such as the settlement base building are not implemented very well and the dialogue, while the main protagonist is now nicely voice-acted, has been ""dumbed-down"" due to it. The UI is cumbersome and needs improving, the optimization of the game seems fairly stella although there are unusual fps drops where there shouldn't be and the visuals aren't exactly ""next-gen"". 

Combine all that with the fact that some important keys are hard-coded and basic options, such as v-sync and mouse smoothing, have to be edited via .ini files make this game just bareable to play at times. It stands on it's own merit, but when comparing it to it's back catalogue, it is somewhat underwhelming.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Gunplay[/b] has been taken up a notch, it is much more fast paced.

[*][b]Sprinting[/b] has been added. It drains AP and gets you from point A-B quicker. Great addition for players who don't like using V.A.T.S as their AP pool is no longer ""wasted"".

[*][b]V.A.T.S[/b] has also been changed, while in V.A.T.S time slows as opposed to stopping, this not only gives a sense of urgency to act, but it can also be benefical in some circumstances. Also crits are now activated by filling up a bar which is gained by sucessfully hitting an enemy.

[*][b]Weapons and Armour now have an in-depth mod system[/b], you can change nearly every aspect of a weapon, from making a longer barrel for higher damage to making an extended magazine for holding more bullets. Armour can have more padding for extra limb protection, or even additional pockets to carry more. There's even armour pieces that can be mixed at will. Bethesda did pretty damn good with this system. [i]You can even re-name them!!! Nothing more satisfying then a ""G2 Fengtender"" or a ""Fengcannon"" ><.[/i]

[*][b]Legendary Loot.[/b] Some enemies will have a legendary tag maked with a star. They usually drop at least 1 legendary item which is randomized. I've found 3 so far and each have unique abilities (e.g I have a Lucky Metal Chest Piece which not only has good damage resistance, it has +2 Luck bonus).

[*][b]Mods.[/b] There are already a ton of nice mods on the nexus, ranging from game mechanic changes to new features (including one I've been using recently, Ammo Crafting). However G.E.C.K for modders hasn't been released yet sadly :(.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[*][b]The UI.[/b] It's just as clunky, if not actually worse, as in the previous installments. This is an indication of a console port.

[*][b]Hard-Binds and lack of important options.[/b] Why the hell are we still getting mouse acceleration AND smoothing enabled by default in 2015 is beyond me. Thankfully some .ini file edits can fix most of the problems, however I wouldn't recommend uncapping the fps past 60, unless you want to play at double/triple game speed. Tying mouse movement and the game engine to the FPS is, quite frankly, bloody stupid. People that don't play with WASD movement will have trouble playing since most keys are hard bound. Another good indication of a console port.

[*][b]Loading times.[/b] Probably on my side of things, I admit, I don't have an SSD yet, but I do have a Black Edition WD HDD which is pretty fast at loading but even so the loading times are long. I can make a cup of coffee while waiting for the world to load. [i]Confirmed (after testing with a new SSD) it IS the HDD. This is still worth noting as not everyone has access to a SSD, the load times can be anything from 20 seconds - 1 minute with the above HDD depending what's loading.[/i]

[*][b]Random FPS Drops.[/b] I can run the game fine on High settings @ 1080p 60FPS, however there will be times where I get sudden drops to about 42FPS, even to 30FPS when there's nothing going on, on the screen to even cause that. [i]This still happens with an SSD just for the record[/i]

[*][b]Very Early Game Power Armour.[/b] Power Armour works differently than in previous installments. Rather then putting it on like armour it is a suit that has to be interacted with. You can get it very early on (as early as 1 hour in) and is pretty useful. You do need to power it however. once it runs out of juice you're basically [strike]running[/strike] walking around in heavy metal.

[*][b]Previous Mechanics Have Been Scrapped[/b]. There is no more karma system, repairing is no longer a thing (except for Power Armour), you can't make your own ammo and, probably the most disappointing thing, NO HARDCORE MODE!!! It's as if Bethesda looked at Obsidian's best features in F:NV and thought ""fuck it"".
 
[/list]

[h1]The Not So Ugly[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Voice Acted Protagonist and Dialogue.[/b] While the voice acting is a welcome new addition, it has also simplified one of the main mechanics of the franchise, the dialogue. No more using your stats for different choices, everything dialogue related is now tied to Charisma. You only get 4 options, most of which are Yes, No, Sarcastic and Info. 

[*][b]No More Skills.[/b] Talking About Charisma, the RPG/leveling system has undergone a overhaul. There are no longer any skills (like Repair/Survival/Lockpick/etc). Instead leveling is tied to a perk tree which is influenced by your S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats. Every level rewards you with a point that can be spent on either increasing one of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats or on a perk. It's a much more simple system that some will like, others won't. A big thing to remember is that THERE IS NO LEVEL CAP!!!. Thank You Bethesda for not locking level caps behind DLC paywalls (for once :p).

[*][b]Settlement building.[/b] Great idea, very poor execution. No tutorial followed by a very clunky UI makes it tedious to use. [strike]The worst thing about it is that it's required (to some extent), it's one of the new main features of the game.[/strike] Kuddos to Bethesda to try and bring something new to the table, but it's very hard to appreciate when it's a complete clusterfuck as it is now. [i]After investing more time into the settlement building I am growing to love it and it's a nice addition. However the above still stands, the settlement building needs ALOT of QoL changes to the UI and useability.[/i]

[*][b]Terrain.[/b] Worth mentioning, the level design is pretty decent for most part, but again like previous installments foilage and terrain block shots. It is so annoying to know that I can see an enemy through a fence and know I can hit them through the gap and instead of getting a hiarker I get a bullet hole 2 inchs away. I could understand this if the world was procedurally generated but it's not.

[*][b]Bugs, Glitches and Crashes, Oh My!!![/b] If there's one thing I've come to expect with Bethesda games it's bugs, glitches and crashes. Oddly enough I haven't come across too many as of yet, just the odd graphical glitches with weapon models, delayed weapon changing and getting stuck on some debris. [i]After putting in some more hours I've noticed these becoming much more frequent, however I've still yet to come across a game-breaking bug. Even so many players on the forums ARE experiencing game-breaking bugs. Save OFTEN.[/i]

377160,Fallout 4,11/30/2015,False,"Fallout 4 is a good game, it just isn't a good Fallout game.

They've completely neutered the SPECIAL system since with enough time and leveling up, you can get all stats to 10, all perks and become the almighty God of the Commonwealth which means you can no longer build your own unique character since you can become the master of all trades. 

They also changed the dialogue system to be Mass Effect-style dialogue wheel, restricted to four choices: Yes, Yes, No (Yes), and a Question. There is no problem with going for a voiced protagonist and restricting the available speech options to four (five if you count Speech checks which almost always boil down to ""Pay me more and then Yes"") if you can back that up with a solid story and good writing. Things Bethesda seem to be lacking. They give you a pathetically short intro in which they introduce you to your family, and whisk you off to a Vault. Why do I care about these people? I don't, but my character does, which leads me to my biggest problem: the lack of roleplay.

You aren't your character, just along for the ride. You can no longer play as an Evil character, or anything resembling such. Diplomacy? Out the door. Guns solve the problems now, and to their credit, the gunplay is a big step up from Fallouts 3 and New Vegas but that's not why I play these games. Gone are the days of playing as a massive idiot who solves all problems with his fists or as a Diplomat who can resolve problems by talking them out whose only skill with weapons is knowing which way to hold them. Or even a compulsive gambler. Want to tell Garvey to go screw himself? Well, you can decline but the quest will not continue until you say yes and get in the damn Power Armor. You can run away but that breaks story progression.

+ Sprawling land that looks and feels absolutely huge
+ Ease of Understanding (controls, objectives, etc)
+ Engram System (I really dig it)
+ Simple Crafting (It's a no brainer to use and understand)
+ Early Access Perks (cosmetic items which are dinky but cool)

[b]CONS[/b]
- Optimization: Needs massive improvement (which is happening! it's a priority with the Devs a)
- Not enough servers to meet the current population
- Not being able to connect to servers/being kicked out of servers
- Sound issues (music/sound not turning down properly even when adjusted) 
- Lag issues across the board. (Some experience it, some do not.)
- Raptors (dude, they will own your butt unless you hit a hill or something. Not really a Con, they're just d*cks)


What little I've managed to play I have enjoyed and really look forward to pitching a tent and staying a good long while but I'm not going to sugarcoat my experience either. There are a lot of problems right now but most of them are due to the Devs simply not pushing a bigger server test before they released -- They simply didn't anticipate the community that slammed their servers trying to play.

I'm recommending it, but please keep in mind that this is a VERY Early Access game despite the fact that there is a lot about it that simply looks, and somewhat feels, polished (the dinosaurs are amazing). If you cannot or do not want to deal with the current CONS then you should wait at least a week and come back and check out the changes the Devs push otherwise I'm saying go ahead and drop the 24.89$USD and try your hand at playing.

you'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!

- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.

- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.

Call of Duty was a major portion of my gaming life. From Finest Hour to MW3 I played it religiously. Although since MW2 I saw it start to lose. This game shows the franchise is dead.
Runs very well on my current machine (GTX970, fx 6300 4.2 ghz), appears to not like on-screen-displays of your system parameters. Graphics are very good as well. Considering they already have DLC (which is outrageously overpriced at this time), it makes me think its unfinished.
[u]THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE[/u]
You will sometimes wait a few minutes to find an available lobby and when you do, you see players you've met before. Over. And over. And over again. Not many people are playing. So far I haven't had any community problems, no trolls or aggressive MLG people who are screaming bloody murder that they got a 400 degree no-scope. Sadly they have also incorporated micro-transactions into the game, and on social media it appears they're inching closer to integrate EVEN MORE of them in the game. It also appears they worked more on the Zombies mode more than anything as the Spaceland map is quite large and detailed for the 2 hours I played on it.

275850,No Man's Sky,12/21/2019,True,"Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. 

I didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.

Performance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.

Hello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.

EDIT - 24/09/2020 ""Origins"" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. 

Brilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from ""I can't stand this"" to ""this is one of my favourite games"".

379430,Kingdom Come: Deliverance,2/17/2018,True,"EDIT: Some additional thoughts at the bottom.

It's about time I put together a review of this masterpiece.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance is, hands down, the best modern true RPG I've played in the past decade. No other game comes close. But, before I get into the reasons why that's the case, let me make one thing clear: This game IS NOT Skyrim. It is NOT the Witcher 3. 

Those are fantastic games but if that's what you want here, you will 100%, unequivocally be disappointed. Simply look at the Steam discussions for this game for countless examples of that. The devs have always been perfectly clear about what this game was going to be. 

If you choose not to do your due diligence and buy into this game just because it looks like Skyrim, that's on you - not us and not the devs. Refund the game and move on. This game is closer to a classic RPG than anything else. Its mechanics are complex, its gameplay is realistic, and the world has a high level of reactivity that you only find in the likes of Baldur's Gate and the early Fallout games.

I also want to be clear that I'm not of the opinion (As some are) that I'm some sort of ""hardcore"" amazing gamurrrr and that I'm somehow superior to everyone that doesn't like this game. I'm simply part of a niche audience that this game was targeted at - all I'm saying is, if you're not also a part of that niche audience, this game is not for you. Please bear that in mind as you read my review.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]

Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a pretty game. Aside from some odd-looking faces here and there (take it from someone learning 3D modeling - creating faces is HARD), the graphics are gorgeous and realistic. Forests are incredibly dense, much more than you'd ever see with something like Skyrim. If you don't look at your map, you can truly get lost in them, especially at night. Animations are, for the most part also very good.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

This game is realistic. If that word turns you off, buy something else. Otherwise, read on. 
Players must manage hunger and fatigue, with drawbacks for ignoring both (no lethal ones, as far as I know), but these aren't annoying like they can be in a survival game. They are side mechanics that never intrude too much unless you really ignore them. If you do, Henry (the main character) will start to have his vision impacted (it blurs and his eyes drift shut briefly every few seconds). 

As previously stated, reactivity is important. Depending on how you behave, how you look, even how you smell, the world will treat you differently. Trying to persuade a peasant to trust you? Wear ratty, dirty clothes and don't bathe. Trying to suck up to a noble? Wear fancy clothes, freshly laundered. There was actually one instance where I looked so terrifying that a bandit who mugged me while fast traveling instantly surrendered when I dismounted and pulled my sword out.

Both you and your enemies can surrender if a fight stops going your way - very few enemies will be bloodthirsty enough to kill you. However, you and they can demand something in return for this. When you interact with a surrendering enemy (if you are distracted fighting their pal, they may try to run away) you can let them go with their weapons intact, demand payment for their release, let them go but disarm them, or continue the fight and kill them. 

Additionally, you don't have to kill anybody in the game, as far as I'm aware (some bosses may be an exception, but I can't confirm that as I haven't even gotten that far). Simply equip a blunt weapon and knock them out if you so choose. In fact, I believe it's possible to completely avoid combat the vast majority of the time. 

[h1]Gameplay, Part Deux[/h1]

The game's skill system is also realistic. Henry starts by being horrible at everything, in true RPG fashion. I say ""true RPG"" because the game puts an emphasis on character skills over personal player skills. 

This distinction is important - one says ""I can be good at everything because I have good mouse aim"" while the other says ""You're going to suck at everything because your character sucks at everything"".

At the start, your bow aim will be wobbly and inaccurate. Lockpicking will be extremely difficult. Pickpocketing will be nearly impossible. If you fail, you must live with the consequences due to the game's save system. 

You are not allowed to save scum. There are no manual saves unless you purchase an expensive alcoholic beverage (alcohol has its own serious drawbacks unless you put perk points into your ""drinking"" skill) or sleep in a bed. That's it. Otherwise, it's all autosaves. 

Now, upon launch, there were some issues with this system. For instance, if you need to quit the game because you're pressed for time, you'd lose your progress since the last autosave or manual save. However, the devs are implementing a system that will fix this - when you leave, the game saves, and you can reload that save once you come back. But then the save is deleted, so you can't savescum. If you don't like the sound of the save system (with this new feature included), do not buy this game. You will hate it.

[h1]RPG Mechanics[/h1]

I briefly delved into the skill system earlier, but I'll elaborate on it here. As I said, you suck at everything to start with. The only way to improve is to try things or visit a trainer but the latter only get you so far - you must fill in the skill gaps between training sessions yourself. Want to improve your speech? 

Try using one of the many bluff options on people (Usually, there's 3 - intimidate, persuade and one other that I'm not sure about, the symbol is weird). If you fail and things go south, again, live with it and move on. You get experience and improve whether you fail or succeed. 

Same goes for lockpicking and other skills. You learn by doing. You can likely eventually become a ""master of everything"" like you can in Skyrim, but it'll take a long time and your best bet is to stick to a character archetype that suits your playstyle. 

Aside from regular skills (which are composed of Alchemy, Drinking, Herbalism, Horsemanship, Hunting, Lockpicking, Maintenance, Pickpocketing, Reading and Stealth), you also have combat skills and stats to worry about.  

All of these skills and stats have perks that go with them. These perks unlock additional abilities and traits, both major and minor. A lot of them come with drawbacks - for example, the ""Beer Bibber"" trait gets you drunk 50% slower from beer, but wine is twice as strong. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

It seems I'm running out of characters, so I guess I'll have to end it here - it's funny because I could easily go on for thousands more words and still not cover everything this game has to offer. 

At any rate, if you like the sound of the game from what I've said so far, buy it! Prove to the devs this sort of game still has an audience.

[h1]EDIT: Addendum[/h1]

In the interest of giving a full picture of the game, I should point out that this game is not without its fair share of bugs and glitches. 

I've heard of users encountering quest-breaking bugs, crashes, and the game not saving properly.

However, as I can only a review a game based on my own experiences, I didn't factor those issues in to my review... Because I didn't encounter them. My saves have remained 100% in tact, even 40 hours in. I've never had an unfixable quest bug. I've never encountered bugs or glitches during combat. You get the idea.

That said, I have encountered several MINOR bugs that have momentarily frustrated me. Horse riding is decent but far from perfect. Bushes and shrubs are very easy to get stuck on or in, and it requires some jump-spamming to get out at times.

The only significant problem I have with the game is performance. Framerate drops are common in cities, and it can be frustrating. But I'm confident it will be patched soon, and part of it is my fault due to having 5-year-old hardware.",37589,1097,76561198010792200,4,45.75 hrs
275850,No Man's Sky,11/28/2016,True,"This was my review prior to the 1.1 update
________________________________________________________________________________
""This game has failed miserably, I am VERY annoyed that I am stuck with this garbage in my game library because it is completely terrible and I will most likely never play it again. When the game first came out it had over 200,000 players on at one point, now there is a mear 800. If that doesn't prove this game is the biggest scam of 2016 I don't know what does. The devs completely lied about countless features that were meant to be in this game.""
________________________________________________________________________________

I clearly had very strong feeling about the game after playing for about 40 or so hours, but now that Hello Games have released the new update I decided I needed to revist the game in order to see what sort of improvements were made.

Obviously the update doesn't add all the features we were told about before the game was launched, but it does add content that we had all hoped to receive and that's awesome. It shows that Hello Games have started taking a step in the right direction in hopes to fix their game. I really did enjoy the game when it first was released, but did quickly realize how much content was actually not in the game. It's very nice to see the developers going back to try fixing this by adding content many players were excited about.

Thoughts about the 1.1 update
______________________

Game Modes
--------------
- The additon of game modes is very nice, I think it's a great way to allow different kinds of players to enjoy the game. 
The three modes are

Normal - this is what most players who revisit the game will know, it's basically the same as before 1.1 but with the new content such as base building

Survival - Practically the same as normal, but with a very steep learning curve. I personally really loved the challenge, you start in a random location on a planet (from my multiple games I noticed all the planets had some sort of harsh environment), and in order to get your ship you have to gather materials and reach you ship (the ship seemed to be anywhere from 8-15 minutes away from your spawn location)

Creative - Much like creative mode in minecraft. You have god mode, and unlimited materials. It's a great mode for building up a base if you want to see what all you can do with it.

Base Building
__________

- The base building is fun and simple. Being able to set up a planet as a ""home base"" was something I was excited about from the start of the game, it's very simple and I can already tell how useful the bases will actually be. They will not be something you spend time on and then forget about within an hour.

- Hiring people from the different races is an interesting way to liven up the bases.

- As you hire people to work at your base they will give you missions to go gather materials in order to advance or learn how to make a new building, the ""base researches"" is a great way to add somwhat of a ""questing system"".

- Within the bases it seems like you have you own personally space stations, which is very nice. No more flying back and forth once you fill up your ship with materials.

- Having a teleporter that can transport you from the space station to your base is actually very cool, I always hated having to fly to the space station just to buy some material I couldn't find on the planets easily.

Materials
_______ 

- The new materials are interesting, I like the idea of needing to research certain equipment in order to harvest new materials.

- Some of the new materials require you to have sort of gauntlet in order to harvest, I think it's great that you now need more than just your multi-tool in order to fully harvest a planet for all of its worth.


As I said above I really enjoyed experiencing the new content and found it very simple yet enjoyable. I think it's great to see Hello Games finally make a comeback after letting down so many people, it's obvious they spent a lot of time on the new content in order to make it up to the older players and to make sure they gave quality content to their players.

________________________________________________________________________________
This is probably the part where I start to get thumbs down because of my review
________________________________________________________________________________

After revisiting NMS and checking out the newest update I think 99% of the recent reviews on this game should be removed. They are clearly people who hardly tried the game before deciding they wanted to give it a negative review like everyone else. If you read their reviews they can't even tell you want they disliked about the game, how can you give a negative review but not explain what you disliked.

I think Hello Games did a great job with the 1.1 update, and I think that most of the negative reviews should be ignored until you get the check out the game yourself.

1128000,Cube World,9/30/2019,True,"This is probably going to be a minority opinion, but the game is good.

I bought the original alpha version of this game years ago when it first came out, and put probably 100 hours into over the course of the years since.  Since getting beta access, I've put probably 40 hours into the beta this week alone.

There are a lot of upset people from the Alpha version that disagree with the changes to progression, region-locked gear, and other aspects of the game.  I understand these complaints, and frankly when I first heard about the changes to the game, I had the same knee-jerk reaction before I played the game and was ready to start shoveling the dirt onto this game.  My last week playing this beta has turned me around completely on the new direction of the game, and as a long time follower of the game I will try to explain why I believe the new version is good.

Let's flashback to the alpha first.  A massive game with endless exploration, infinite leveling by grinding monsters, and gear that followed the typical RPG rules, staying the same as you traveled.  That's all well and good, and it's exactly what one would expect from an RPG.  The problem with the alpha version of the game is that despite having skill trees, exp based leveling, and persistent gear, the games always ended the same way for me and my friends.   By around level 20, you would have everything unlocked, and the game was reduced to hand-gliding across areas for 10 minutes, stopping every now and then to stomp a boss in 5 seconds, then go back to gliding again.  Rinse and repeat.  You have these massive areas but no reason to stop and explore, no reason to visit the towns, no reason to talk to NPCs.  The skill tree added an illusion of character customization, but in reality was served little purpose since the combat related skills once unlocked did almost nothing except reducing the cooldown of your abilities by .01 seconds per level.

The beta takes a bolder and riskier design approach.  All class abilities are unlocked right form the start.  It treats each zone almost as its own game.  Instead of flying over them skimming for bosses, each area is its own adventure.  You start fresh, talk to the townsfolk, try to learn where artifacts and other key items are regionally found, and set out to explore every nook and cranny of the area.  The areas are littered with content that rewards the player regionally within that zone.  Saving a captured gnome will boost the regions shops to sell better gear.  Finding a rare crafting book unlocks new crafting recipes for that area.  Finding shrines unlocks a new place to revive if you die, and they double as unlockable fast travel locations which makes finding them rewarding and useful.  Finding reins, a boat, or a glider gives the player quality of life mobility upgrades to explore that area better.  The dungeons which are far larger then those in the alpha reward the players with rare artifacts, which level the player up by rewarding them with small passive boosts to their swimming, climbing, sailing, riding skills.  None of these are combat related, but they do carry over once you leave a region.

The new system is akin to playing a randomizer everytime you enter a new area.  You start as a weak pleb, you thoroughly explore an area for key items that improve your quality of life, while trying to get better gear to let you tackle a regions bigger threats, and ultimately get the artifacts.

So the big issue most people have is the fact that once you move onto a new region, our old gear will be reduced to basic starter gear in a new area unless it's a super rare + piece of equipment.   These rare items will retain their old power in neighboring areas only.  The debate from detractors is that gear should never be diminished once you leave an area.  While this sounds good in theory, it literally flies in the face of literally all of the content that's been designed in the last 6 years.  Literally every aspect of this games content is based around this new progression system.  Allowing players to keep their gear under this new system would devolve the game back into the alpha version with all of its flaws.  Shallow gameplay that consists of flying over zones to snipe bosses for levels.  The new system has a lot more longevity and reverting to the old system would completely invalidate literally all of the new content.

The current system is not perfect, there is always rooms for improvement and growth.  But as much as I played the alpha, we have to take off the rose-colored glasses and recognize the major flaws it had which led to stagnation of the gameplay after a few hours.  The artifacts could be broadened to give a wider array of passive bonuses to other stats even in miniscule amounts, the cities could provide you with more information about a region explaining how many artifacts are hidden or when you have found everything.  There could be some sort of reward for full clearing a region.  The game could also do a better job at explaining itself to new players.  The foundation is here.  If development continues post launch, it will get even better.

At the end of the day though, this current version of the game is a blast to play in single player (can't say that for the alpha which was boring very quickly solo) while retaining a multiplayer experience that's fun to play with friends.  Joining games with your friends is easy to do via an in-game menu, and works great minus the occasional DC which simply requires a reinvite.  The new progression system means you don't need to worry about your multiplayer sessions being ruined if one of your friends plays too much, since meeting in a new regions brings people back to a mostly level playing field minus swimming or climbing a little faster and such.

I look forward to seeing the evolution of this game because the foundation is a blast to play and well worth the asking price given the amount of hours I've already played this week of beta.  I'm sure there will be a lot of detractors praising the alpha and denouncing the progression system, and it's certainly their right to do so.  It's not going to be for everyone, and it's a very different game than what it used to be.  Honestly for me, it's a better game.

281990,Stellaris,6/27/2017,True,"I believe this is the definitive science fiction game for those who enjoy the 4x genre, as it provides infinite freedom, to a reasonable extent, in customizing a stellar empire and its policies. Although the gameplay sometimes lags behind progress indicators, especially in the mid-game, the combination of numerous, well-implemented mechanics driving everything from war, infrastructure, research, exploration, colonization, and everything in between serve to continually engage the player in all aspects of celestial governance. The game possesses boundless replay value, as every different policy, ethic, travel mode, weapon, or starting location forces the player in an alternative path to victory than the previous game, forcing the tough, grueling decision between investing in economy or military. I definitely advise purchasing both the base game and the Utopia expansion, as Utopia retools the ""culture"" tree in this game to add ascension perks, similar to the ideology perks in Civilization, that add end-game bonuses and ascension paths for your people. Regardless of your intent to make a materialist, roboticist, scientific directorate or a militarist, psionic, spiritualist empire, Stellaris is the 4x game for the science-fiction inclined.",87909,1154,76561198065510600,2,42.98 hrs

377160,Fallout 4,11/10/2015,False,"Fallout 4 is okay. It's not revolutionary, it's not fantastic, and it's not what every open world post-apocalyptic rpg should be. I don't exactly recommend people to not play it, though I don't know if I'd recommend buying it at full price. If you're really hankering to play a Fallout game, play New Vegas to your hearts content. If you're really sick and tired of playing New Vegas, you'll get enough milage out of this and more to enjoy the price range.

The Good -
- The crafting system is pretty great. I was pleasently surprised by it. I expected just an expanded version of FNV's system, which wasn't compelling because finding specific ingrediants for things was so boring. Instead, every item (mainly junk) has components, and those components are what's used to build new things, rather than the items itself.

The Okay - 
- Perks are... okay. It doesn't signficantly change the game, really. The interface for selecting perks is, thankfully, significantly better than Fallout 3's. So nothing really good, nothing really bad.
- Building settlements is... okay. Maybe I'm just not a builder, but I don't find it that compelling. It's not perfectly smooth, and a first-person builder is rather clumsy, but it's not frustratingly so. 

The Bad -
- Don't expect any revolutionary story telling. Bethesda has always been great at building worlds and making the game fun to play, but terrible at writing compelling characters. I've yet to meet any really dynamic characters. Everyone feels flat and one sided. It's at the level of Fallout 3, though the companions are slightly more interesting, where the system itself (of companions reacting to actions and then engaging in special dialogue when you hit a certain threshold of liked) propels it above 3, but the flat writing doesn't stand up to FNV. 
- VATS isn't significantly better. Charged crits are a good idea, but it's a little wonky, and the same old problems FNV had of your executions taking years is still present. Not only that, but now VATS doesn't pause the game, which is the entire point of VATS.
- The game seems like they decided to port it to the PC at the last minute. Which they clearly didn't, so I don't know how some of the terrible interface choices made it to release. All of the dialogue is limited to 4 options (90% of the time it's yes, no, maybe, and info) and the most intuitive way pick choices is to use your arrow keys. The favorites menu also expects you to use your arrow keys, and this time also hitting enter after making a choice. Favorites also no longer pauses the game, so you better grow a third hand if you want to make full use of the favorites menu during combat. When was the last major PC game that asked you to use WASD, the arrow keys, and your mouse?
- Player dialogue is a huge step back. Always being limited to 4 choices is very limited for a game like Fallout. They've taken out any indication of how difficult a speech check is besides a very vague color, which is a huge step back. They've also done what many games have done and given you only a vague idea of what your player is going to say. I don't know if ""Sarcastic"" means a playful joke, or me being an enormous asshole. And half of the dialogue choices have ""Sarcastic"" as an option. Why can't you just say what my character is going to say? ""Sarcastic"" is not descriptive of what I am going to do. 

All in all, Fallout 4 is an okay game. Terrible interface design decisions and bland storytelling plague this game, leading it to just be worse than FNV, and not significantly better than Fallout 3.",63341,3066,76561198014273400,37,42.57 hrs

-Every player is forced to spawn on a starter island at first. This creates a bottleneck where a fraction of players are able to even play. It is possible to buy this game and not be able to spawn.

-Half the world is tundra/polar zones where resources are scarce and you cant build basic tools. A large chunk of the zones are spawn zones where you cant build/claim land. This leaves 15% of the islands in the world ideal and habitable. They have all been claimed by large groups. 

-95% of the people who wanted to play at launch couldnt due to the servers eating ass. The people who were able to get off starter zones during this time had no issues and were able to snowball their levels and tech. 

-30 hours to travel the world means nothing when you can create a few beds and teleport between them. 

-It takes 10min to claim land and 2 hours to remove someones claim. This means larger groups are taking over multiple islands and are notified as soon as you try to unclaim their land. Without land you cant build and advance in the game. 

-You will not be able to play this game to any degree as a solo player. At least in ark you could hide, in this game you have to announce your position via claim, which shows up on the map and when pressing H. 

-All the npcs you see in the trailer dont exist in game. None of the towns are a thing and people just build boxes like Ark. 

-During the twitch streamer event there were ghost ships, floating bottles, treasure hunting. In the trailer theres mythological creature hunting, mermaids, dragons, etc. None of that exists.

-Hit registration and auto aiming features are completely trash. The game forces auto aim to a degree when meleeing. You can disable it in options and it still exists.

-Death is meaningless. You can put a bed on your raft and die over and over while sailing. You dont need to eat. Dont need to drink. Dont need to manage the completely idiotic vitamin system. Just die and respawn on your bed then harvest your corpse for hide.

-an ok Total War game (missing gameplay mechanics from previous titles, feels somehow barren)

Now to the biggest issue I have with this title:

The DLC policy is abhorrent. They charge 17 euros for a SINGLE race, when there are still numerous ones to come out. It looks as if they took EA's 'The Sims' strategy, thanks to which by the end of the series you will have to purchase a couple hundred euros/dollars worth of additional content to get the full experience.

377160,Fallout 4,11/11/2015,True,"I've logged a couple hundred hours in both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.  After putting in around 20 hours into Fallout 4, my opinion can be summed up as follows: great game, terrible port, with a few misguided attempts at innovation.

Pros:
+ Fantastic character customization.  Even without more detailed controls, the system allows for truly unique looking characters.
+ Great characterization.  I've frequently heard people claim characters are ""bland"" and ""boring"", but those that I've run in to so far have been anything but.  I think that this opinion stems from the first few hours of the game, when you're first getting a feel for things.  Preston Garvey is admittedly pretty bland, as well as the inhabitants of every tiny settlement until you reach the edge of Boston.  Once you start getting into the nitty gritty of it, you'll find some charming characters.
+ Good AI, improved companion AI.  This is another point of contention.  I've seen people complain that the AI is bad, but in my experience, it's above average when compared to most other AAA titles these days, and leaps ahead of where Bethesda was with Skyrim and the previous Fallout.  Enemies make frequent use of cover, attempt to flank, etc.  Companions position themselves to accurately fire down at people.  I've had very few issues so far.
+ Amazing gun/armor customization.  Glad they added in layered armoring.
+ Music.  Great song choice, cool radio station, funny announcer (though I do hope he'll actually tie into a quest at some point).  Non-radio music is also great.
+ Environment and Level Design.  Very pleased with how it turned out.  Plus, the increased amount of outer-cell and vertical-gameplay oriented areas makes me very happy.


Contested:
= Dialogue.  I don't like the four-button system, and I don't like the whole ""color indicated difficulty"" with speech checks.  I very much prefer a flat threshold.  That said, the dialogue is fluid, the multi-person conversations are a refreshing addition, and I can't bring myself to outright dislike this.
= Bugs.  This is probably the most bug-free Bethesda release I've ever seen, not counting the problems associated with Gamebryo or the game's status as a mediocre port.  Still, the bugs are there, and they are occasionally jarring.  Every major release should expect some bugs, and Fallout 4 seems about average for the games industry rather than for Bethesda's historically poor track record.
= Story.  I can take it or leave it, which may be better to take as a bad sign.  If this game were linear, this would be a major downer.

Cons:
- Controls.  Jesus, the control scheme is bad.  UI is terrible.  This was a case of people reassigning keys to be used on the PC rather than giving it the attention is deserves.  This is probably the worst of it.  With a decent UI, almost half the problems with the game would instantly disappear.
- Voiced Protagonist.  Ties in with the above.  Personally, I find the voice actors did great jobs doing this, but it still doesn't fit, and completely removes the ability for me to make a character of my own, which was a large part of the appeal.  I can't get wrapped up in this character's problems.  I can't bring myself to care about his/her plight on the Earth.  I think this is mostly a matter of poor execution.  A voiced protagonist would work fine if they also managed to keep the character's motivations ambiguous, and not have it so heavily reliant on a preestablished backstory.
- They dumbed down the ""RP"" in ""RPG"".  It's now an FPSrpG.  I want my perk/skill based dialogue checks back.  I want there to be moral chocies that shape how my character is seen.  I want there to be a karma meter that shows how I'm perceived in the wasteland.
- Gamebyro and all of the issues associated with it.
- Terrible PC options.  You'll have to go directly into the preferences & initialization files to change things like mouse acceleration and FOV.
- No holstered weapons.  This irks me more than it should.  (Clarification: I meant that when a weapon is holstered, you can't see it on the player model.)

Not Rated:
~ Performance.  I have a very high end system, so I can't speak as to how nicely this runs on budget machines, but I've heard good things.

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,12/2/2013,False,"Straight to my vote: the game is ""somewhat"" playable after patch 7, not total garbage like on day 1, with some mods the score could reach a 6/6.5 (average), though some moments on campaign/battles can be rated easily as an 8: unfortunately these moments happen not so often and don't last very much.

But i'm downvoting it because the game has still SERIOUS BUGS, GAME DESIGN FLAWS, and the BEHAVIOR OF CA IS TOTALLY OFFENSIVE on its fans.

These especially make me totally pissed:


-Combat system is totally arcadish and not enjoyable: fastest battles of the franchise, magic abilities, BS flags, TORCHES, formations don't matter, blobbing, almost no ""gameplay"" unit diversity between factions.

-AI alternates moment of cleverness to totally stupid moments, especially on sieges, where sometimes the AI freezes, and, if you are the defender, you are forced to sally out, or wait the 60 minutes timer goes off (siege AI on Rome I and Med 2 was a lot better, and those AI were not the top: after 3 months from release is still not properly patched...).

-Boring and broken naval battles, alongside a horrific non-working political systems.

-Stripped down features from previous games (guard mode, family tree, fire at will for legionaries and so on).

-CA  keeps releasing BS panoramic screenshots or trailers, saying they are made with Rome II engine (they are not, they are trying to cheat more people with that BS!) instead of creating cutscenes especially designed for the game (a big lack on the game)!

-Instead of properly patching the game, they are keeping releasing DLCs over DLCs. Till now we have blood&gore, nomadic pack, greek states pack, caesar in gauls, and this doesn't stop. And that stuff needs patching too...

-Lies over lies on marketing pre release campaign; i'll mention only one aspect: performance. They said a lot of BS about how well Rome II would be considering this aspect. You can even read ""extremely scalabe experience"" here on Steam description (yeah, my ass!). They didn't release a DEMO prior to release for THE FISRT TIME IN THIS FRANCHISE: now i know precisly why the didn't make one.
 The game has seriously engine flaws: the worst are no proper multicore support, and the fact that CPU (and not GPU!) is used for some intesnsive gfx tasks, which brings to high CPU bottleneck-->low FPS, especially on melee.

-Lack of immersion elements: no connection  with generals, no family tree, almost no faction intro videos/cutscenes, boring and repetitive musics.

-Horrific UI: they have gone from the perfection of Shogun 2 to the actual crap!

And i can continue to go on, but let's stop here...


In the end: ALMOST NO CHALLENGE (sometimes the challenge turns out as frustration), NO IMMERSION, NO FUN LIKE ON PREVIOUS TITLES.

And this is really a SHAME, considering the HUGE AMOUNT OF BEAUTIFUL ASSETS made for this game, such as beautiful units and their huge variations of helms, shields armours and so on; along awesome landscapes and cities and huge number of factions.
Moreover this is double shame, considering that many aspects of the game where way way better on the old Rome I and on the previous Shogun 2.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,11/28/2015,True,"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015.  The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards. 

GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them ‚Äì somehow all three of these characters‚Äôs path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other‚Äôs story.  The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game‚Äôs physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics.  I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between.  The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire‚Äôs collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored. 

The game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren‚Äôt photo realistic, but that‚Äôs because the game‚Äôs style isn‚Äôt aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console‚Äôs version to shame when you compare the two.  My rig which is a monster, couldn‚Äôt handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game. 

As with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character‚Äôs story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other.  The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing. 

The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren‚Äôt real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on.  Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map. 

The game isn‚Äôt exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don‚Äôt think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty. 

Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day‚Äôs work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.

The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races‚Ä¶so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose. 

Technically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here.  The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game.  The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly. 

I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore;  it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is ‚Äì it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here.

397540,Borderlands 3,6/8/2020,False,"[u] The biggest disappoinent I've had so far. [/u]

Nov 2020: For those who got no time:
No character development, no interesting arcs, not a single good dialogue, no immersion, missing characters, rewritten characters, ignored/ cancelled past events, laughable animations & cutscenes, bad art direction, loot-system is beyond f*cked, terrible forced humor, boring leveldesign, utterly atrocious and hollow villains, worst story of all time in any media ever, not even a rewarding ending- exactly the opposite. Almost everything in this game exists purely as an annoyance to the player.
A huge middle finger to all the fans. More details below:

I was a huge BL fan. And since I heard a lot of negative feedback before I started playing, I tried to look at BL3 as neutral as I could. It still managed to disappointed me to the point, where I dropped the franchise.

[u] The good: [/u]
- Yes, the gameplay is a bit better than it's predecessor. Ledge-grab & sliding are a nice addition. Though, sliding is completely useless - not a single map requires you to do it. 
- Graphics obviously. Though I really, really miss the thick outlines from the cell shading. They were charming and unique.
- The guns got more oompf and have overall more interesting designs, better sound, animations & weapon skins. 
- The Soundtrack does mostly a good job at mixing things up while also keeping the Borderlands vibe.
- Bandits are more varied, though they lost humor.

[u] The meh: [/u]
- Voiceacting is.. okay at best. But most of the time it's very obvious, they're reading of a script, which just breaks the immersion.
- UI is too cluttered. Too many colours. It's clunky, slow and bad at handling a lot of items. I also miss being able to see yourself in the inventory, where you could turn around your char. 

[u] The bad: [/u]
- Old characters are either completely rewritten or missing entirely from the game.
- Great characters are being tossed aside after 2 missions, while new shallow, annoying and utterly dumb written ones get all the highlight.
- The sound mixing in this game is just bad. Got a 5.1 system but had to set it to stereo, since I could not hear anything as soon as I looked away from talking NPC's.
- Players voice is so overpowering loud in contrast to everything else, it's so annoying. Sound options don't help at all.
- Gearbox thought it was a good idea to let the player talk.. ALL THE TIME. And since each character has only 10 lines to say, every 15 seconds you hear a really ret*rded, cringy clichee line, that only cheesy kids cartoon villains would say. It's so bad with Amara. I want to slap her each time she says: ""I cAn FeEl tHe pOwEr!!"" or ""mAkiNg hEaDliNes!"". No one would ever say that. And her jump sound is so overexaggerated, she's as annoyng as the ""villains"" themselfes. But more to that later.
- Leveldesign is extremely underwhelming. So many copy-pasted assets everywhere. Nekrotafeyo was the only place where it felt like, it was truly a different world.
- Eden 6 is the biggest area in the whole game and it's just a big swamp.. with more... swamp. It's design is extremely bland and boring. Just awful. BL3 goes interstellar and they make swamp worlds.. wow.
- The Vaults are so disappointing.. again! This is the 5th entry and they still f*cked the vaults up so hard. They are all [spoiler] the g*dd*mn same copy-pasted cr*p. Gearbox was like, nah man, done. Let's call it a day. This is so lazy, it hurts. The whole franchise focuses on the vaults and then it's just an artifact to read text logs and 4 chests containing white & green items. Couldn't even care to script some unique rare weapons there. [/spoiler] They just didn't care. Very questionable..

[u] And the complete garbage: [/u]
- Loot-system is broken beyond measurement. Legendaries drop as often as blues in BL2 UVHM. There is not a single point in picking up anything below Legendary, since the game gives you 20+ in less than 2 hours. I got 9 Legendaries from one mission, which renders them completely unimpressive. Because of this, I don't even look at purples anymore. In just a few hours of playtime, my entire inventory was full of gold gear. I can't for the love of everything make sense of this. Why have over a billion guns when only maybe 100 are actually interesting? Marketing, I guess. And the saddest part is, that most legendaries are complete trash too. 
- The Vault Hunters are so uninspired, boring and annoying characters, it's so sad. They constantly yell and scream full-ret*rd-mode. I'd rather have quiet characters again, than having these constantly sh*t talking gremlins, that give you cringe goosebumps every few seconds.

- All the animations in this game are not motion captured, which means they are just garbage. Even an untrained eye can spot how stiff and clunky they are. A triple A 2019 game with that budget should have mo-cap. 
- The cutscenes look like someone from Deviantart made an amateur fanvideo. They are so unbelievably bad, It's the only time the game made me laugh. From awkward camera angles to extremely bad amateur animations. The pacing is so off, they weren't even trying. So, so unbelievably awful. And what the flying f*ck happened with their faces? Everyone is so ugly now. Art direction? Hello?! Where are you at?

- And to the final act of this clownshow: The ""story"". I actually still can't find proper words for this ungodly monstrosity they call a ""story"". It's easily the single worst piece of awful BS that I've ever encountered so far. Not even in videogames, but movies and series as well. The fact that not a single soul at Gearbox was like: ""uhm guys, this actually sucks f*cking gigantic balls."", is just depressing. The Calypsos had great potential. But then they started talking. God, those awful voices they got. I want to vomit all over the place each time they open their badly animated, ugly mouths. They're just huge pathetic twitch vag*nas, with absolute zero backround story, no real motivation. The game wants you to believe there is but boy there isn't. The ""twists"" are so last minute made up, it's just a big insult to all the fans. That moment when Troy finally seemed to evolve from a leech to something greater, the game decides to throw it all away and act like it never happend. It's so blatantly obvious, that they had no idea what TF they were doing with this continuation. Then the whole siren ""plot"".. just really, really st*pid. So the writers decide to take ALL the established siren rules and throw'em out of the window. Why? fanfiction, that's why. And then they continue to make up new ones, that contradict with everything we know. It's the most merciless form of lazy writing I've seen so far. Truly atrocious. Can you believe someone got paid for this? Heck, my dead grandma could write a better sequel than these buffoons.

BL3 ripped bigger plotholes into the franchise than the eridium scar of pandora. It's like they really, really wanted to f*ck it up. Garfield-effect had better writing than this dumpsterfire.
- Nothing in this game gets taken seriously. A few of your beloved characters die? NPC's make fun of it with unfunny jokes and everyone instantly forgets about it. Are you excited what the guardian at the end of TPS meant? Too bad, that script got cancelled. Never happened. Wanna know what happened at the end of Tales of Borderlands? Too bad, writers are actually too lazy to care and ignore it all.

And let's just not even start with Ava. The single worst, r*tarded ugly f*ck of a character I've seen in anything ever. And the god forsaken credit song at the end- I wanted to shoot myself. Truly, f*cking awful.
Borderlands 3 made me feel I'm watching a 40 hour long trash movie. Sadly not even a good one.

I'm not nearly as angry as I make this sound like but I really had point it all out. I honestly don't care about the pros. The cons overweigh BL3. BL2 is such a better experience in almost every way. Hopefully they hire a competent writer for BL4. f*ck me.",67909,1332,76561198086547500,6,39.92 hrs
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,12/2/2016,False,"If this game was split into two Steam hubs for the Single Player and the Multiplayer, the SP would have a 99% positive and the Multiplayer would look like No Man's Sky. It is an excellent single player game, but mimics a trash and cash-grabby freemium game for multiplayer. It seems like Rockstar only sees their players as wallets.

The lowest price this game has gone for is $30, so wait until then. When you do, just stick to single player. For a good open world multiplayer experience, head elsewhere. 

Cons first, pros second.

[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]

Rockstar intentionally designed their online ecosystem to be like a cash-grabby mobile game. You are able to own property, vehicles, etc. However, you have to earn currency by playing similar grindy missions/heists or competitions. This seems great in concept, but the numbers are intentionally designed to make you feel like it would be easier to just ""buy"" the in-game currency with real money. Also, if you come from the single player, you get much less cash in general, so you are getting less money than you are ""used to"", which contributes to the aforementioned psychological pressure. Yes, you can theoretically get it all with time spent in-game, but this is similar to the League of Legends IP model in which the time spent per money acquired is so low that you are constantly pressured to just spend the real money. This sort of constant pressure does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.

There are superfluous accounts of Rockstar refusing to appeal any bans for online play. The ban-worthy offenses include but are not limited to: using any overlays, recording software, voice chat software such as Discord, etc etc. Oh, and make sure to hell that you don't EVER mod the single player, because that'll get you banned in multiplayer too! (maybe this is why Bethesda doesn't do multiplayer?)

Let's also not mention that some hackers can appear in your public games (because you can't do these grindy missions by yourself) and just spawn money over your head. You can go jump through a bunch of hoops to try to get rid of that ""hacked"" cash, but even the fact  that this is possible is ludicrous. 

How on earth are you supposed to prepare so much for all of these detrimental nuances? No one should have to be this scared and pensive to just play multiplayer normally, but it primarily exists as a cash grab to support the ""free"" DLC that Rockstar releases (which you need to acquire with in-game currency, of course). 

If you get banned, you will get ignored. Rockstar already made their money off of you, so who cares.

Rockstar also has a history of greed by refusing to put the game on sale during Steam sales. They instead will lump the game at the reduced price and throw the ""Shark cash"" in with the, so it is tough to find it below 60 bucks. You probably won't want to play multiplayer anyway. 


[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]

This is one of THE best single player games I've ever played. The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun. 

As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port (most recent example being Final Fantasy XV), as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance. 

One of my main complaints is that hitting a high vehicle speed can make the rendering suffer a bit, but it's not a big deal.",30429,1104,76561198007784800,85,39.90 hrs
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,7/18/2016,False,"2020-04-23 UPDATE: 
Thank you to everyone that have voiced their concerns to Creative Assembly / SEGA for trying to split newer Total War titles into as many pieces as possible. They have since started releasing free content updates (lords, units, factions) with every paid DLC release. I still find it ridiculous that blood is still sold as a DLC (see comments for more details). 

Total War Warhammer is an amazing game, and everyone interested in real-time strategy should definitely give it a try. Just be aware that a lot of the content is sold separately as DLC.

I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D",23778,1512,76561198176296500,41,39.88 hrs

This review will be different and aim for the game itself hopefully you'll read 

First i wanted to say i considered myself so lucky because i was able to join the beta test, honestly i wouldnt have been able to wait the games full release.

This is a 4 Player online platformer that has a great mechanism in controls and really addictive and easy to pick up on.
The game has 2 Player Co-op Adventure mode, Or 4 In Arena mode.
Adventure mode can either be normal or INSANE ( insane mode, is one death mode basically)
The game can be pretty brutal in some stages with insane mode.

Arena mode Targets 2v2 team and has a lot of great endless fun modes
Capture the Fla... Horse .. its called capture the horse which is same as CTF but a horse that looks like a piece of walking candy, and even more fun
Or Basketball which is my personal favorite and its something you wont play just once : )
And a lot more Modes from soul catcher ( Kill and get their souls) To ""Grab the gold""  9 Different fun modes.

The mechanism of the game makes it possible to do a great teamwork in adventure mode.
You can pick up your friend and throw him or he just simply jumps on your head to reach a high place and then lifts you up to join him, or use a weapon to blast your friend to a certain places, and just be creative with what you wanna do :).

A huge selection of weapons and faces, ( You can make your own face and put it in game folder for everyone to see)
the game is basically Get the (Certain number) of Gems in each level and reach the end in the best time ( And the hidden yarn ball ) 
Gems buys you Faces, Yarn balls buys Weapons.

WITH! the ability to Trade them in-game or in steam trading system, or even sell them on steam market.
Which is a good feature because you cant buy a certain thing you just buy and the outcome is random.

Each weapon is different and has a different use and great ways to make combos with.
You can either play good to finish, play dirty team killing, or see who can reach the end first.
Some levels however relies on teamwork cant afford to be selfish there.

With this ADORABLE looking graphics and soundtracks fun can never end, They made it even more fun by making Level Editor to make your own levels/playlists of levels, arenas or whatever the hell you want to make.
Steam workshop was definitely a great feature for the steam version.

THIS Game has the FUNNIEST STORY I have ever seen in a video game, Every Cut scene you will be a FOOL to skip it because its just ... too .. funny and perfect with that amazing narrator.

its sad that they asked that no one posts a review or livestream or a video while on beta, but everyone did anyway .... and so i tried to make this review as resourceful as possible, so people would actually get a clue of what this game is if they never heard of it before or was wondering about it.

This game is worth every penny, watch some youtube commentary videos on its gameplay and decide for yourself :)



A Few updates.

they keep adding some special faces you can get by finishing every once and a while so its cool

and for summer sales people are wondering if the game is worth playing just for singleplayer 
yes , i have maybe 20 hours stored only singleplayer playing this wonderful game alone is also fun and the levels changes when you play singleplayer to be set to solo mode ( Makes it possible to do everything solo ) and in multiplayer they are set for double so you need someone else to help you finish the level or you can also use the weapons to do it alone if you're good enough with them.

So yeah its pretty much fun singleplayer grinding for faces and achievements is always fun : )
hopefully you'll make the right choice and buy this and make sure you have friends to play with 
its more fun that way",44404,1586,76561198080435100,176,39.83 hrs

517630,Just Cause 4,12/21/2018,False,"Just Cause 4 forgets its origins.

In JC3 the game and it's story seem carefully crafted to NOT take itself too seriously and just enjoy its mechanics of mayhem and destruction.  The witty banter, an over the top dictator, enjoyable destruction via wacky physics, and a whole mess of over powered weaponry entertained me through its main game and all its DLC.

JC4 on the other hand takes a turn from some of those elements.  Rico isnt as funny anymore and is border line brooding. He doesn't have any witty companions, the story seems to want to take itself seriously and some of those wacky physics are a bit too wacky.  The departure from its predecessor came as a suprise to me and I believe is a direct result to some of the lesser gripes I was muttering to myself as I played the game.  

The choppy water was gone and had been replaced with really crappy looking water. I know, not a big thing, but the waves in JC3 gave life to that part of the game.  It's hard not to notice its absence.

Helicopter controls became worse and it was almost impossible for me to target enemy choppers using missiles.  I hardly even know how to describe this issue with text. I literally can not shoot a missile at a flying enemy unless the aiming reticle is on them and turns red, but if that enemy is moving forget about it, because you have to lead your target only you can't because your reticle has to be on the target to get it to turn red so you can shoot at it unless its moving...ARGGGGGHHHH!

Some changes, like removing grenades and replacing them with secondary functions on certain weapons have left me on the fence. Most of the secondary functions are great and enjoyable, but I personally like the staple of having grenades at all times. If that was something I wanted to maintain as I played it meant that I had to carry a specific weapon with me that had that secondary function.  And since you can only carry two weapons with you I often times felt limited.  

Planted explosives are also gone which is something I miss.  

The map just seems so much smaller than JC3.  I bet this staent is false, but I burned through it so damn fast it felt* smaller by comparison.  

The introduction of front lines where the rebels are fighting the enemy initially seemed like it would be a cool thing, but there was so little impact to whatever I was doing or how I was progressing through the game it made me wonder why it was there in the first place.  

Instead of liberating multiple small settlements to free zones now all one has to do is a single mission. And there are only 3 or 4 versions of that mission and they just aren't as engaging. It seems odd to look back at JC3 and find that the repetitive nature of freeing settlements by blowing up the same damn things was more fun, but there it is.

I don't really hate JC4. I can still do goofy things and I have fun with the new tether options that are available.  I gripe because it moved away from things that I liked or expected to see again from JC3.  This game falls into the category of sequels where instead of getting the previous game plus more*, I got a little less with some changes that just didn't measure up to its predecessor.  I haven't given up on this game, but I won't likely spend much time on it unless the DLC's bring something special with them.",94866,1254,76561197961273800,9,39.15 hrs

814380,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,6/11/2019,False,"Sekiro gets rid of build variety, item variety, customization, and creative gameplay in favor of a very stripped down, very focused experience. It's tightly-designed and extremely thoughtful in its implementation with a high gameplay skill ceiling. The game is punishingly difficult with very little in the way of shortcuts. The only way to progress is to learn the game and increase your skills. Your character doesn't get much stronger, you have to.

Some people really enjoy that! I wasn't one of them and found Sekiro tedious after the midgame. Another tough miniboss, another back-and-forth samurai duel on the rooftop, another guy with a spear,.. You fought this boss, now fight it again with triple the health. There's no reason to replay the game because there's no different way to play, you'd just be doing the exact same thing again. If you like the gameplay, then this is a plus but for me it lacks the endless replayability of other FromSoft titles, plus you have to be Boring Gruffdude the whole time. 

It's an extremely well-designed, well-polished game that (for me) got boring and which I have no desire to play again, and certainly no desire to buy DLC for. But that's because it wasn't designed for me. If you like fast-paced, technical gameplay that rewards persistence and practice, you'll find many of the boss fights cathartic.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,12/10/2016,False,"(I play offline: More than 50h played)

As a day one fan of the Total War series I can honestly say that TW: Warhammer is, overall, a pretty good game and I am indeed one of those people who find their deepest wishes for the Total War series addressed in this iteration. 
While many people cannot seem to get enough of alleged ""historical accuracy"", I have always found that yet another type of spearmen with a few points of damage more or less and a differently coloured shield gets a bit dull in the long run.

Warhammer obviously presents a radical game changer here and anybody who even remotely likes fantasy settings will certainly find themselves staring at the screen with a big grin on their face as all kinds of monstrocities and creatures armed with just about any imaginable set of weapons duke it out before their eyes.
A lot of this is really just fluff to be honest. There is still a TW game under the impressive reskin and whether 8 foot Orcs carry huge bone-cleavers or the infantry of the empire sword and boards into a battle really doesn't matter: At the end of the day it is still about familiar values such as attack strength, armor value ... you get the idea. ""Big ones"" such as huge spiders or giants are only seemingly an exception here as they also have those familiar values and will find their counter in units that deal ""bonus damage vs large"" just like spearmen would deal bonus damage vs cavalry in other TW-games. Big ones are big. That's about it.

As refreshing the fantasy unit rosters are, the tactical depth of the game falls a bit short because the familiar Spear/Sword/Cavalry/Ranged rock-paper-scissors system has not really been replaced with a fleshed out alternative. Large/bonus vs large and armoured/armour-piercing appear to be about the only systems in place here. Special unit skills like shield wall, wedge formation, flaming arrows etc. are removed from the game. Whether you hire a spear unit, a cleaver unit or a spider ""cavalry"" doesn't matter that much and is largely just a question of personal preference and unit tier.

Armies are always led by a commander-unit, the uniqueness of which is non existent if they are not magic wielders. As these field commanders level up they get incremental increases in strength, hp and morale. Special skills can be unlocked here but are flat buffs to the commander himself, his army or certain unit types in the army. There are no charge commands, unique rally abilities, special attacks or anything of that sort. Magic wielders can cast spells which is fun but not as impactful or gamechanging as one might expect.

While the tactical field battle side of the game therefore is indeed ""dumbed down"", I still find it to be a lot of fun. Honestly, special unit ablities and a rigid rock-paper-scissors gameplay in other TW-games got on my nerves at times because it directly translated into a lot of micro management und babysitting. With a few exceptions and respecting unit tier, you can just pit any unit against another and they will do just fine in TW:Warhammer. 

Part of the fun in battles comes from the impression that the AI is notably more competent this time around. You will still see a lot of TWs longstanding AI problems such as commanders leading the charge fearlessly and therefore being the first ones to die or units running in circles after enemies which they couldn't possibly ever catch while being wittled down by your archers. However, none of these flaws appear consistently and the AI generally maneuvers sensibly and effectively tries to make the best of the resources it has.

On the topic of longstanding AI problems, I am glad to see that TW:Warhammer has finally achieved a strategic equilibrium on the campaign map that I would almost call ""good AI"" if it hadn't been achieved via a few cheap tricks: Units are very expensive and factions will have a lot less units than in other TW titles. Since armies must then be led by commanders and commanders are also expensive, you and the AI alike will compound existing units into just a handful of armies. This means that the days of winning wars by ""stack wiping"" legions of puny little reinforcement armies are over. The majority of AI-armies you encounter will indeed be effective fighting forces that present the full might the respective faction currently can field. 
Yes, army composition is still a problem and AI armies will still lean towards being largely composed of cheap, basic units that easily fall prey to your carefully assembled elite banner but this problem has at least been alleviated by patches and can further be alleviated by certain mods.

The most important improvement in AI campaign strategy is then a direct result of the reduced number of armies: The AI knows how to handle those few armies and actually challenges you in TW:Warhammer. While in earlier TW-games even large enemy factions never quite managed to effectively go for your weak spot but always were quite adept at presenting you with an abundance of weak spots themselves, in TW:Warhammer the AI actually DOES things. E.g., if you decide to send your one banner all the way up north to conquer a certain province, you can pretty much assume that your enemies in the south will try to capitalize on this and come knocking on your door while nobody is home to open it ... kick down this very door, the AI then will. Awesome.

TW:Warhammer consequently plays out quite a bit differently than other TW titles. Hours and hours of consecutive conquest campaigning while micro managing endless reinforcement supply chains and fighting hundreds of default-win skirmishes does not happen here. You have one, two, at most three pretty decked out armies on the map that kind of act like pieces on a chess board. You never move these pieces all that far from you homeland and often fight for money or missions and not for actual conquest plans. The AI does the same. 
The economy revolves around extremely high maintenance costs and comparably low recruient costs. If you or the AI loses an entire army, the faction income will simply skyrocket from not having to pay all that maintenance anymore. Recovering and rebuilding is therefore very doable and you will see that AI faction (or yourself) back in shape within just a few turns.

Like I said, technically the engaging back-and-forth on the campaign map is not a result of actually good AI. The ""cheap trick"" here is that the rules of engagement have changed as described above and TW:Warhammer is therefore quite a different, somewhat simpler and clearer game than other TW games. ""Simple and clear"" enables the AI to actually compete because it can finally handle the reduced amount of strategic moves and decisions. I can see how many people are dissappointed because the game is not really that complex, detailed empire management simulation anymore. I for one like it because it empowers the AI and I don't reach that point of grindy boredom all that easy.

I like the game and this would easily be a thumbs up if it weren't for all the DLC bullshit that comes with it. I believe that Sega and CA are much less at fault here than people claim.  
Games Workshop has always been at the forefront of capitalizing on the need and greed of adolescents, getting away with absolutely insane pricing for decades. Via their modular, pay to win tabletop economy, they pretty much invented DLC when personal computers weren't even a thing yet. Their reluctance to give away their licence to competent developers for the longest time has spoken volumes about their corporate greed ... well ... even GW has finally arrived in the modern age and steps in with its ageold maximum profit model: 
18‚Ç¨ for unlocking a single faction! How can I possibly overcome that nagging feeling that my game is incomplete? Should I get a second job to afford the hundreds of DLCs that will come out? No I should not. PC gaming is not tabletop. Period.

After the DLC release while in early access and the sudden price hike, while still being poorly optimised and having shallow gameplay doesnt make me agree with it any more.

I personally do not find the content of ark to be worth the price hike recently, its the same shallow, repeatable, start from the beginning again unless you play 16h every day that is the same with Rust, 7 days to die and other indie survival crafting games. Most of the updates have either added DLC or new dinos and areas without fixing poor optimisation and the glaring issue of hackers.

I do not support these devs nor do I support their terrible business practices, thats why I reviewed this game with how little hours I have played.

218620,PAYDAY 2,10/15/2015,False,"A money-obsessed pale imitation of the first game.

Payday 1 was essentially ""Left 4 Dead, except bank robbers."" It's a simple formula that worked really well. The long, objective-rich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale. Gunplay was satisfying, enemies were challenging, and the DLC added a new class to screw around with. A few maps and secrets got updated as free updates.

Payday 2 is nothing like the first game.

The sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game. In lieu of lengthy, interesting campaigns, each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives. Prepare to see the same areas, again and again. Stealth has been overemphasized across the board--killing yourself to restart is a common occurrence. The difficulty just isn't there compared to the first game, either. The matchmaking is also random gen and a complete mess--gone are the easy lobbies of the first game.

It gets worse! The unlock system is heavily dependent on RNG. Customization is RNG. Everything in this game is RNG except leveling.

The game has had DLC after DLC heaped on it. During a sale, it becomes a reasonable price.. when it's off sale expect to pay $50+ just to unlock a decent amount of content.

The game has blatant product placement. John Wick is shoved in your face as a free character. Why this doesn't get more negative feedback, I'll never know.

The new DLC came free of charge.. with a caveat. Now you can enjoy CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 crates, and pay $2.50 to unlock them. As if the game couldn't become more money-grubbing and obsessed with profit. Did I mention the crates are factored into the RNG loot, meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them, you can still lose out by getting them when you don't want them?

Game use to have a modding community, too. Overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch. Maybe they'll fix this, I don't know.

Am I against all DLC? Not at all. Plenty of games make great use of DLC. But herein lies my point. This is not a free-to-play game. This isn't a game in which the DLC is cosmetic. You have to pay for the game. Then the DLC, which encompasses characters, weapons, and campaigns, is also paid for. The game has product placement blatantly inserted into it. It then on top of that wants to insert microtranscations. This game has done everything it can to insert pay wall after pay wall. 

For what should be a simple, Left 4 Dead style cooperative game, the amount of grind and pay-for-content in tis game is absolutely absurd.

Edit II [22 I 2021]: Wow, this blew up. Thanks for all the points, guys. I thought to address some of the comments. Some valid, some not so much. 

Here is the thing, there are people who buy the game at- or near- release, and they have to pay a high financial price for it. Time goes by, game gets cheaper. This is, I daresay, a reflection of economics. It's kind of like going to the cinema when a film first premieres (expensive), and then watching it on Netflix decades later (-almost- free). It seems justifiable for DLC to remain expensive for first-movers. Theoretically there is a first-mover advantage, if nothing more than the fact that multiplayer servers remain more populated. But yes, beyond a certain amount of time (and here I cannot actually say for sure how long), the DLC prices should be moderated.

Secondly, the fact that I paid a bit less for Platinum than someone did is not really relevant to the point. It is kind of like saying, ""hey, OP got poked in one eye, she should be happy she didn't get poked in both eyes."" I submit, humbly, that we should be going after the rogue eye-poker, instead of the eye-pokee.

Thirdly, someone was saying that marketing is prone to exaggeration. This person, I suggest, is not legally educated. There is a difference between ""mere puff"" and ""misrepresentation."" For about 25 years between 1990 and 2015, ""Gold"", ""Platinum"" and ""Game of the Year"" Editions have been known to denote a rather specific arrangement of games, usually to the effect of the inclusion of the base game, together with all the expansions.

Words have meaning. To quote a mediocre film of a good book: ""Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth."" If words do not have meaning, then one day you will find yourself served sh*t on a shingle, have that called ""breakfast"", and you will be happy to eat it even if you aren't.

Great work Dev Team, keep it up!

Edit(12/17/2016):

I fell for the hype and purchased the game when it was nearly full price (I did use a coupon to lower the price before buying, because I never really buy games at full price). It was a mistake. The base game was great fun for about 4 hours, and then it fell apart when I started to see that the gameplay was overly repetative and the features were lacking.

This update brought many features that brought me back and had me playing for many of the hours I refused to invest in the first version of the game due to the fact that it just felt tedious.

I agree with many that the game should have been launched as a $20 or less indie game, rather than at a big budget cost.

I also agree that the 1.1 update brings some items to the game that should have bee there to begin with. As I said, 1.1 is how the game should have launched... and add that to the edited in comment about $20 dollars or less being the pricepoint.

They made a ton of mistakes in the marketing and launch of the game, however I have hope that it can still be made great long after the hype, and be enjoyable. I have hope that somehow they can patch in a large sum of content that might bring the value closer to the price point it launched at, however I know that is not very likely.

I am not forgiving the horrible marketing of this game, and far too early featureless release of the game. I'm just hoping they can keep adding to the game that I already own, and continue moving it in a direction that brings it closer to the hyped promises that brought me to purchase it early on at launch.

20hrs of XCOM BABY later, and I've just dismissed my ""Sharpshooter"" for several other ragequit misses, including no less than a 97%. I heard he has since been employed on an Imperial Star Destroyer as a Stormtrooper. 

To make this review ""more helpful"", I feel I should add that this IS a game worth buying, though missing often (and often you will) can become a real frustration - you find yourself grinning in sweet revenge when the same RNG happens to the Aliens and they miss you from from point blank range.

Shooting mechanics aside, the only other issues I've come across since playing are:- 
*Mission timers (which mods can fix already). Plus, this is a personal preference, it's not a fact that this makes the game worse. I actually enjoyed some of the missions when realising I had 3 turns remaining to act out the impossible. You really think about what skills you have remaining and use every resource possible to inflict the greatest amount of damage while moving forward as fast as you can. All normally works out well... Assuming you hit the target, that is! *ahem*

*The occasional bug / framerate drop (which will no doubt be patched very soon). Again, this is computer specific and really, I hardly noticed it once I tweaked my settings. I had to lower a few things, but no biggie!

That's it. I see no real reason not to buy this game, especially if you liked Enemy Unknown/Within. I'm currently finding myself pinned down at times on Normal. Yes, NORMAL, and I have no Ironman, and I still finish some missions thinking ""Wow... How did I get outta that one?!"" I can't wait to (hopefully) survive this playthrough and crank up the difficulty to make it even more of a challenge.

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,11/1/2016,True,"The number of idiot reviews is mind blowing.  I hate having to write such a non-traditional review, but enough is enough.  There has  been so many issues with people misunderstanding what they were getting and people expecting things that weren't meant to be expected, and all sorts of common sense issues.   I'll try to address many of the issues at hand.



Q:   Is this free?


A:  If you owned the original game and the 3 DLCs before a certain date (believe it was close to this release), then you can get this game, for free.  If you bought the DLC or the game or the game and dlcs afterwards, then you are SOL and will not get it for free.



Q:   But why should I buy a game for $40 if it's just some 5yo game but 'remastered'?


A:  If you truly liked TES series, then to be blunt, you would have had gotten Skyrim and the 3 DLCs, thus worrying about this being an issue, but if you somehow didn't, or if you didn't even buy Skyrim itself, then this version would be a good version to buy.  You get the game and the 3 DLCs all combined together, which last time I checked, was cheaper than buying Original Skyrim and the 3 DLCs.   That alone should help save money.   There are even other features to this that make it simply better for the everyone.  However, not everyone gains as much benefits from this as others may.



Q:   My heavily modded with ENB  Skyrim game looks and runs perfect.  Why should I bother with this version then?  


A:   If your game runs perfect and can run all the mods your heart desires, then don't bother with this.  This version of the game was clearly not meant for you since all is well for you and your game.



Q:   Well it doesn't run perfect but it still looks so much better than the graphics from SSE.  


A:   Wait, are you trying to compare a vanilla game to a modded game that was only 5yos?    It's almost as if mods will make a game look better than a vanilla game, oh wait.   Of course a modded game will make Skyrim look better than vanilla SSE, and that's hardly a fair comparison. Once more mods are converted, this game will look just as good, maybe even better, than the original Skyrim.   Also, Bethesda never said that their remastered game would look better than a modded game, just better than the original vanilla game, and it DOES look better than vanilla.



Q:   What about bugs?  None were fixed, and some were even added.   heck, my 900 series graphics card is lagging!


A:   No one said that they would fix bugs.  People just assumed that 'remastered game = bugs fixed"", but all Bethesda said was that they were going to use the new engine to overhaul the graphics.  As for any new bugs, that's to be expected with any new game and yes I call this a new game because it was released, rather than updated.  One issue pointed out and soon to be addressed, it the sound compression.  I personally can't hear it that easily, but others have, and Beth. said that they will look into it for a future fix.    As for laggy graphics with high end cards, there is one possible fix for that, and that is to make sure the game does NOT use your integrated graphics card.  If it does, then you will lag badly, so just change that and most likely, the issue will be resolved



Q:   I want my mods to run on SSE.  Why won't my old mods work?


A:  Few mods can work due to the nature of the mod, but for most, they won't work because they were made for the original engine used for Skyrim.  Now, it's a new engine which means the mods must be converted and that may take some time for certain mods, while not much time for others.  That's just how it is.




Now that I got that out of the way, I'll just post some of the good and bad things about it even though many of them will be known by now due to the trailers and marketing things that have mentioned the changes.



[b]Pros:[/b]


+ Free to anyone who bought the game and 3 DLCs before this release

+ 64bit support, which means more mods can be run by people while having smooth performance

+ Texture updates makes things look sharper for vanilla

+ Rain and snow occlusion makes for small visual changes

+ Water flow improvements

+ Different mod system that allows mods to be controlled within the game (still some issues with it but its new, so it will take time)

+ Various QoL changes.  One example is that you can now have separate save files for different characters.


[B]Cons[/B]:

- Slightly high price might turn off new people but it has all the DLCs combined which makes it a better deal for those who don't have the game.   Bad deal for those who only had the game or the game and not all DLCs

- Not worth switching over too (assuming you have this for free) IF and only if the original game runs at perfect conditions for you already since it will only mean even smoother performance which most likely will not be visible.




[B]Conclusion[/b]:  This is a great improvement from vanilla Skyrim by quite a bit.  If you played the original Skyrim on vanilla, then you will see the difference when you play here on vanilla.   There are more graphical settings that allow for tweaking that can improve visuals or performance.   There are even small changes that just improve the playing experience.  While its a shame they didn't bother fixing some minor issues (boxes turned wrong way, grammar issues) to bigger issues (quest bug making quest unfinishable), they didn't say they would fix bugs and thus they did what they said.",50715,1483,76561198046257000,90,35.85 hrs

377160,Fallout 4,8/26/2017,False,"[h1]Preface[/h1] Buy it when its on sale. The game is a massive overhaul of the former 3D Fallout titles. All actual thinking is removed from the game and now perks mean nothing. Get your overpowered suit of armor 10 minutes in, kill your first deathclaw 12 minutes in. I can't help but ask what is going on in Todd Howard's head. The game revolves around a 3 phase core; 
[list]
[*]step 1: go to a location; 
[*]step 2: kill everything at said location/complete a shitty quest; 
[*]step 3: loot everything you can and move on to the next place.
[/list] All the ""RPG"" elements of Fallout are stripped away from the game in favor of a more [i]accurate[/i] representation of combat. 

[h1]the graphics[/h1] The art style is okay I guess. Some of the locations look bland and boring and quite frankly I prefer the locations from 3 or New Vegas over these. The color choice is honestly quite sketchy at best and at worse just plain boring. It's akin to going outside and looking at dirt, then turning around and looking at a pile of rocks, then turning and looking at a pile of bricks, then turning and looking at a pile of dog shit. I understand its supposed to be gritty, but couldn't they have made some scenic areas? Something like adding some still functioning neon signs or maybe an area where the vegetation started to regrow? Regardless at its core the game is overall pretty bland on the color choice. Some of the textures look quite hideous for the amount of time and the hardware of todays standards. They don't necessarily detract from the gameplay experience, but when you notice them they do detract from the overall immersion. 

[h1]the story[/h1] Okay, lets talk about the story. [spoiler]A nuke crashes into the Boston area and your son gets kidnapped from you at the vault you take shelter in.[/spoiler] Not a bad premise for the story, but not an original one either[spoiler]and by that I mean the kidanpping part[/spoiler]. It's better than being a prisoner who becomes a savior by far, but nothing new on this front. The only problems I have with the story is that it isn't very memorable nor does it have any reprecussions for you ignoring it. You can spend 2000 hours not giving a single fuck about your [spoiler]kidnapped son[/spoiler] and nothing happens. No synth takeover, nothing. It would have been interesting to have a time limit of sorts to [spoiler]save your son[/spoiler] and if you dont get to [spoiler]him[/spoiler] in time then a massive synth incorporation into the society happens. Why this was never thought of or put into the game I'll never know. 

[h1]the sound[/h1] Overall the sound design is pretty good. I like the aosperic sounds of the world and it made me feel more engaged in it. Even the creatures of the world had very wonderful and creepy sounds, I loved it. The guns on the otherhand sounded like... well kinda weak. When I fire a gun in my neck of the woods it makes a loud [b]boom[/b], but when I shoot in Fallout 4 it just feels like I'm playing with an [strike]airsoft gun[/strike] a spring gun. It's unsatisying to hear all these amazing overworld sounds and creature sounds and then when you go to shoot it just feels... meh. In this aspect it makes me feel more obligated to playing a melee character which is really fun. Speaking of which 

[h1]the gameplay[/h1] The combat in the game feels pretty solid, especially the melee parts. Every hit makes nice impact [spoiler]not really damage-wise but thats what I get for maxing out the difficulty[/spoiler] and its overall an enjoyable experience. The gunplay is very solid too, every shot I can tell exactly where it's going to hit and shooting things is quite a nice experience. The VATS system used in this game is pretty cool, I like how instead of stopping time like some sort of DIO-esque character you instead slow time to slightly faster than a crawl but slower than a second. The killcams also look quite good and allow for some pretty gruesome screenshots. If you want to get this game the best factor of it is the combat hands down. It's not perfect but it's the best its ever been in a Fallout game. The exploration isn't as rewarding as they make it out to be and the randomly generated loot just makes the grind even more of a grind. Adhesive is going to kill your mid to late game if you don't stockpile it as soon as you get started. 


[h1]the crafting[/h1] I like the idea of crafting upgrades for your weapons and adding say extra damage or extra firing rate give the already lackluster weapons some actual viability on harder difficulties. Of course punching things is the only good meta in the game though and using a suit of power armor just makes the game a cakewalk. I could easily sneak through any area with a power armor and my fists and kill literally anything that moved, breathed, or had a pulse. Giving something that fundamentally broken so early on is a fool hardy move and also given that the combat even on the hardest difficulties is nothing short of piss easy it makes the fanbase move on to getting mods that increase the difficulty or change the start of the game or the ""perk"" system. 

[h1]the ""perks""[/h1] Alright so let's move on to the meat and potatoes. These aren't perks at all, they're minor passive buffs to stats with specific weapons or with your ability to not eat dogass at picking a lock. The only perk in the entire tree worth getting is Blitz. In fact, its so useful it helped me break through walls and almost broke a quest for me [spoiler]it did however break the castle quest and now I can never complete it[/spoiler]. 

[h1]my TL;DR[/h1] The game at its core is flawed and a mess, however that isn't to say the game is awful. It's an average game full of below average qualities with an above average combat system and a superb sound design. If they would have tried to make the game more like an ACTUAL fallout game (y'know like with choices and stuff) then I think it would have been a far better title. Gutting the perk system and replacing it with this bastardized shell ruins the RPG element and basically put it on par with a Call of Duty clone or an MMO but singleplayer only [spoiler]commentary on how ESO is literally singleplayer the multiplayer experience, but not[/spoiler]. The foundation is there but they forgot to put up the walls. And fill in the floors. And put in plumbing. And put in a powergrid. The game falls short on so many levels to its predecesor that honestly I wouldn't even recommend it at all unless you really want to play it for the combat. But then why are you even playing a fallout game if you care about the combat.",54700,1827,76561198058393500,5,35.35 hrs

242920,Banished,10/24/2014,True,"Banished is the best city builder I've ever played (and I've played a lot, having been a fan of the genre since the original Sim City and the old Sierra historical builder games). The game is deceptively simple, you start with a few settlers and minimal supplies and you build a thriving settlement. Sounds easy enough, but it's probably one of the most challenging games I've played.

There are a variety of crops, animals, and natural resources. Your setttlers will plant and gather and use these to build a rustic town. Steel tools and stone houses represent the pinnacle of your settlement's technological advancement. You can barter goods with a few visiting tradesmen and some nomads may periodically ask to join your settlement, but that's the limit of your outside contact. Peace reigns, you won't need any military (or even police) here. The only hostile forces you will encounter in Banished are tornadoes, fires, diseases, starvation, and cold. And you will encounter them, a lot.

Although the game is relaxing to play, it can at times be incredibly difficult. Your settlement might be going along nicely for 100 years, with plenty of food and lots of citizens available to fill all the jobs that need to be done, and suddenly everyone has cholera and you're closing down the schoolhouse to free up some child laborers to expand your cemetary. Banished is brutal that way. But it's also beautiful. The music and graphics and effects are really appealing, and the immersion factor is high. It's definitely one of those games you can sit down to in the early afternoon and play for hours and hours and then be surprised to find your stomach growling and oh hey when did it get so dark outside?

The developer is very active and involved in the community, and new features are added often. Now the game offers modding capability and Steam Workshop. So far the community has responded with some amazing tweaks and additions which only make the game even better (also a little easier, if you find the challenge a bit much).

 I can't wait to see how Banished continues to evolve, which it seems to do in much the same way that my tiny settlements grow and evolve, with all of the little details coming together to make something really satisfying and enjoyable.",39975,1410,76561197977594500,72,34.65 hrs

  [td]I have never played a game that offered such satisfying zombie smashing. On top of that, you have a variety of ways to dispatch of the zombies.  The sound design is incredibly well done (save for the voice-acting, it is average at best), every smack of a weapon against a zombie is satisfying and has some weight behind it. Also notable is the parkour system in place in the game; It is extremely well executed, and gives an incredible sense of freedom to go where you want, and do what you want. The weapon system is reminiscent of Dead Island's, though gathering parts feels much more intuitive now. Missions feel varied enough that they don't come across as just ""fetching"" quests. They even serve to push you out of your comfort zone and into the dreaded night.[/td]

  [td]Easily join up with four friends for some co-op fun which allows you to play the entire game together, main quests and all. Though frustrating at times that you must have EVERY player in the vicinity to start a mission, or even have dialogue with an NPC, the frustration is quickly forgotten as you get back to bashing zombie's heads in. Occasional co-op competitive events show up as you travel around the map, challenging you to beat your friends at killing the most zombies, finding the most loot, saving survivors, or racing to an objective. An absolutely hilarious blast of a game to play with your buddies.

  [td]Of all the zombie games out there, Dying Light is number one on my recommended list. A well polished, extremely fun game by yourself, throw some friends into the mix and you have a winner. If you enjoy zombie games in the slightest, or even if you don't, give this game a whirl. Thanks to Dying Light, I find myself bummed out when I play other games that I cannot jump and climb so freely. You know something has been executed well when you find yourself wishing it was in every other game you played.

With their help I was able to unite the Benelux region under my rule, gaining more precious factories and people to force into my legions. I helped the mighty Reich in conquest of France, being rewarded with another small chunk of land. Everything was going according to my plan. But then a certain Austrian thought it'd be smart to attack the USSR. At first everything was fine, but then, oh god... Then the blasted British landed troops in France. So here I was facing the hordes of imperialist pigs while my best pal was off in Russia causing havoc. But I knew what I had to do. I had to stall them as long as  possible, and that I did. Eventually Italaians and few Germans came to help and the British advance was slowed down or even halted at times. Good, good, just a bit more time. I'll show those islanders how ""weak and pathetic"" I am. I'll show them. In late 1944 the first nuclear bomb was produced. But I couldn't drop it without air superiority, so I waited and built up more airforce to help the Germans win the air war in the regions. And the help I provided proved very significant, the might Luxembourgian air force dominated the skies and allowed me to drop my revenge. Oh what a wonderful sight it was to see London in ruins. Does this seem weak or pathetic to you? Does it? Thought so. Sould've accepted my into yourfaction you wankers.

This review focuses on showing you the flaws of the game. It is a ""not recommended"" review, because it contains all the information that might make Stardew Valley a title that you might not want to purchase. I'll try to give you helpful information so you can make an informed decision as to why you may or may not want this game in its current state and I will point out possible fixes to mentioned flaws along the way. If you want to know what this game is doing right (and its doing a lot of things right), please read one of the many recommended reviews. Thanks.

As the gameplay appears to be really solid and polished, my complaints focus around the barebone nature of how the game teaches you how its mechanics and world work, which may cause you as a new player confusion and/or frustration.

I will also change this review if some or all of my issues get fixed with future updates.

[url=http://community.playstarbound.com/forums/suggestions.74/]Thread that reflects what people would like to see changed in/added to the game.[/url]

[h1]The UI is lacking quite a bit[/h1]
Note: UI Complaints focus on K&M usage.
~Inventory~
The Inventory handling is inconsistent across the many different menus. Sometimes left-clicking on an item will bring it to your hand, sometimes it will move it to your box and sometimes it will sell the entire stack, even though you just wanted to move the item. 

It is far too easy to missclick with your mouse.

The options menu is only available in-game and due to its scrolling nature and the little space it has to show its content, it looks and feels really messy.

Having to click on doors to walk into them is unnecassary. Let me walk into the house without the need to click on the door.

The distance to be able to look or talk at something should be greater. I want to talk with the guy behind the counter.

[h1]Learning who is where and when and why ;_;[/h1]
I really like that NPCs have their own day and night cycle and interact with each other. But this creates problems, which I think are not handled well in the game.
Right of the bat the game tells you with a quest ""Go meet ALL of the people, there are 28 of them.""
But Learning the cycle of 28 people (some more complicated than others) is not something you will be able to do in your first couple of days. Now to see where everyone lives you just have to look on the map... Except that it only shows you for some of the houses. This problem amplifies when you want to meet a shop keeper, track someone down to give him the item for a quest or simply gift your sweetheart something. 

I really see no problem with needing to learn all of the cycles, its kind of charming and feels like something you would need to do upon moving into a village, but the really should aknowledge this. People who have trouble understanding or accepting how NPCs work in this game, could be helped by framing their mindset. Just let a NPC tell them in the beginning, that they are not in the city here and everyone is having their own lifes or something along those lines.
Sidenote: Not being able to gift people on festivals is sad, as it would be the perfect place to finally have every one of them together in one place.

[h1]The game, sometimes, does a terrible job at explaining its mechanics[/h1]
I'd like to think that good games have good tutorials, but great games [b]are[/b] tutorials.
Games completely without tutorials or only barebone explanations rely heavily on conventions and the trust that the audience knows them. I think Stardew Valley trusts its audience too much and relies too much on conventions of the genre.
While I am heavily against dumbing down people by telling them the obvious for minutes on end, avoiding to teach you anything isn't the right thing to do either.
This problem seems to amplify as more mechanics are introduced later in the game.

[h1]It should alway be the players fault, not the games[/h1]
Usually you should teach the player everything to avoid frustration upfront and all the extra information, like reading books, talking to people, should grant you some neat little extra advantage. 
As one example: Never pro-activly telling the player that all your crops will be erased from existence once the first day of a new season rolls in, can be [b]very[/b] frustrating. You do not gain anything by hiding this information in an optional book/optional TV-Entry. This could be easily fixed: Let the shop-keeper tell you the first time shopping, or, optionally, if the player never got to go to the shop-keeper, let him come to your house at some point in mid-spring telling you all you need to know.

[h1]The game feels a bit empty(in the beginning)[/h1]
There doesn't seem to be a lot to do in the first few days, because you have to find everything on your own, and nobody is telling you anything. This sense of being lost can be very charming when done on purpose, but right now, it doesn't seem to be intentional.

In Harvest Moon titles, usually the first thing to do was to meet all the new people in town. You usually easily spend half of the day just talking to people and they would tell you all about the town and themselves, while giving you tipps. This sucks you into the game world and serves as a good spike in the overall ""action"" curve.

In Stardew valley, people don't tend to tell you much upon the first encounter, which is a shame and a bit of wasted opportunity in my opinion. A bit more text in the beginning, especially for shop-people to instruct you a bit more, would be very appreciated and could increase immersion drastically.

[h1]Sometimes the dialogue does not make any sense and it repeats a lot[/h1]
These are the little things that make you go from ""Holy shit I played 5 hours?"" to ""Well, I played 2 hours now, lets stop."".
Someone telling you ""I will teach the kids today."" when they are going home at night to sleep, is weird.

Also: After playing a while I get the same dialogue from someone every 3 or 4 days, which somewhat reduces my motivation to speak with them again.

[h1]Quests/Tutorial[/h1]
The game tries to teach you some of the important things, like how many people there are in town to interact with and how to gift them, through quests. I think some of the learn-quests are not very thought through, especially considering the nature of how hard it may be for you to find all the people. I think some of these quests could be easily removed and replaced by some non-optional in-game dialogue, to reduce potential player confusion and increase immersion.

[h1]The fishing mini-game is not easy[/h1]
This is more of a warning than a suggestion, no need to change anything about this, BUT some people seem to be really pissed off by this mini-game, even to the point to give the game a negative review. So be warned if you are used to ""click once to get the fish"". You'll need to work to get your fish.

[h1]The Festivals remove an unreasonable large chunk of time from your day[/h1]
Most Festivals take at most 5 minutes to complete, including the time needed to speak to everyone. Once the Festival is over (most of them start in the morning), it is 10pm. I want to know what happened in between, right now it just feels like the game is skipping a lot of time for no reason. Either add more content to the festivals or let them start later/end sooner.

PS: The review is positive, I love it. Kinda seen everything in it but, I enjoy it. Multiplayer games tend to have a short life span (Particularly Indie ones), directly related to the player base. If this goes one month without *Content* updates (which is very very very likely to happen) players will drop it, uninstall, and find a better MP game to stay on. It's a huge task to keep a MP game alive, but one can only hope.

And for anyone in the comments, this might not be the best place to express concerns. There is a discord https://discord.gg/QxvWuqX which is very active.

578080,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5/27/2017,True,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle-royale, 100-players, open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.

PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further. You've struck the gold.

My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion:

[h1]Pros[/h1]
1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle-royale PvP games are mostly in Early-Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game - PUBG is exactly the opposite.

2. Great gameplay concept. No pay-to-win and no grind-to-win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.

3. Non-toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team-only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.

4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no-scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often, especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety; Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet; Deciding your next 'safe spot', etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists - not too steep and not too lean. 

5. A shooting game that applies semi-realistic weapon recoil, bullet travel time, and bullet drop is always appreciated.

6. Various vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, clothings, and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay - It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.

7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV, the game supports both FPS and TPS.

8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
1. Currently, very performance-demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high-end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum - virtual RAMs can't help your 4-gigs-RAM PC. In terms of GPU, one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from <30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.

As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list: The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops, crashes, and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high-end rigs. It happens randomly - I don't measure the frequency.

[i]UPDATE: Although the game is still quite laggy, minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080. Most performance issues are related to server lag instead of PC after June 27 update.[/i]

2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example, you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover, but 2 seconds later, blood spurts out of your chest, you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you, but then...okay you get my point

3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2, you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in-game.

4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.

5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three, four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game - devs better fix this quickly.

As a response to the comments' feedback: I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally, 1, or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid: The controls are NOT reactive - horrible for a PvP game.

6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive

7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead, the game throws me back 3, 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building, throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes, these happen randomly.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Don't lose all hopes because of my cons list - remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay, but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle-royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.

Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!

[u] [b] CONS: [/b] [/u]
- Campaign levels are incredibly short. 60 minutes and I had already completed 5 stages on hardened 

- Enemies are all deadshot, even behind cover at any difficulty (difficulty only changes the rate at which they shoot you with 100% accuracy). Hell, they are even accurate when blindfiring from cover.

- Because of how accurate enemies are at any range with any weapons, mounted weapons are really fustrating to use, especially madatory mounted weapon sections where you absolutely can't dismount the weapon you are forced to use. There's no cover, and you [b] can't take cover [/b]. Worse still, the gun requires a somewhat lengthy reload after just 50 bullets (some uses a cooldown system).

- Characters are pretty forgettable in all honestly compared to something else like Brothers in Arms, COD 2, or even Company of Heroes Tales of Valor.

-  Ally. Useless (can't shoot for sheet) and annoying. Screaming ""MED PACK READY BRUH"" ""GOT YOUR AMMO BRUH"" every few seconds.

- Microtransactions on a full priced AAA game. Solely cosmetics or not, just NO. 

- Settings between SP, MP and Zombies [b] [u] DO NOT [/u] [/b] carry over between each. So you'll have to manually set all of them again (i.e if you fine tuned your SP settings, you gotta do the same for MP and Zombie). It's a hassle.

- Bugs & errors (e.g error 4128).

- Hackers everywhere. Reporting them doesn't seem to help either.

[u] [b] PRO/CON [/b] [/u]
- Can't complaion about the visuals. It's not bad, but its nothing to rave about either. I won't go into nitpicky details on ulgy textures, but as a whole, so long as you're not going out of your way looking (i.e zooming in at a particular rock) for it, the game looks and runs just fine.

- QTE. Not a fan, but not totally adverse against it either. Some QTE sequence require you to move your mouse in a circle (kinda like telltales games I guess?) and there are some variety of different buttons to press, so its not just smash X button all the time.

- HP regen, I don't like it, but at the same time i don't not like it. I'm confused, it does what it does, but it doesn't feel as ""fluid"" as something from say, Dying Light, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Half Life and Halo. I'm guessing that the slow animation to heal is for balancing purposes (i.e you can't just heal in an instant) but then again, I have played game with healing animation and they don't feel as off as this. It's not bad, but its not [i] good [/i] per se? Idk its hard to explain.

- Enemy AI aren't exactly stupid as they know when to try to flush you out while flanking you and blindfire as you try to advance towards them, but they do really stupid things from time to time like throwing a bomb that bounced back and killed themselves or ""taking cover"" right infront of you (and the cover is facing the wrong way).

- For a game that prides itself alot on ""historical accuraries"", there are sure loads of jarring historical inaccuracies, even on the very first level alone. But I'm not really complaining since some of them are beneficial, like german units using weapons they weren't suppose to have (e.g "" troops ""Sten guns"", historically speaking, german made ones were called the MP 3008, and it was avaliable ONLY for the Volksstrum, not the Wehrmacht or any branch of the military, even in desperate times. The MP 3008 was literally a really crap copy made in haste to arm fanatical civilians.)

[u] [b] PROS: [/b] [/u]
- Sound designs are pretty good. they feel heavy when they need to be and ambience have its moments of tranquil breaking into a furry of bullets and explosions.

- Zombie and MP are okay (zombie is really good imo, had always wanted something similar to COD WoW zombies for a while now), nothing much to shine or bash on. Aside from the absolute bs that is the microtransaction (and how they've impliment that degrading patent it into COD WW2), it does what it does. Though I'll admit it is really weird seeing a negro nazi running around.

- Amazing settings design for PC, wide variety with helpful screenshots to better explain what each settings does at what setting (i.e Texture at med, high, extra). Something like what you'd see at geforce.com

- You cannot truly just ADS and empty the entire mag in a single burst with laser accuracy (atleast in my experience). There's a very noticable weapon spread at range even while going prone. Hipfire is pretty inaccurate aswell.

- Auto presets for lefties.

- Surprising range of weaponary

- WW2 themed (like finally i suppose)


TL;DR: It's fun, but the asking price is too high for the content avaliable (Get it for 30 USD or less). If you're buying this solely for SP, don't bother (even with discount) its incredibly short and unmemorable. The set pieces don't even feel grand or pumped (like COD WoW Downfall  or COD2 Ponte de Hoc). Now I really wish there was a ""conditional thumbs up/down"" system because I'm recommending this game, for its base game content value, [u] AT 30 USD OR LESS [/u] (absolute max I'll say is 40$ and that's really pushing it). Buying the full edition that comes with the season pass and bonus map is really ludicrous for the average joe earning average wages (also if I were a parent,unless wealthy af, dropping 60$ or more on a game that isn't that content filled would make me squint at best and straight up no to buying at worse. Adding microtransaction ontop of that doesn't help either). Oh and microtransaction is still crap, regardless if you're opening a box in private or a box that appears from the sky for everyone to see.

edit4: Microtransaction [b] ARE NOT [/b] cosmetic only now.


[u] [b] Details about the microtransaction (as I understand) [/b] [/u]
Something I believe lots of people are interested in knowing about. I'll put it in bullet points so its easier to read

-They're all cosmetics onl- [i] SIKE NOPE [/i]. Contains emblem, [b] gun [/b], gun skin, emote, icon, etc.

- You can earn lootboxes via the game's ""orders"" (functionally speaking, they're pretty much challenges).

- What are ""orders""? At the HQ, there's a place (the game will guide you on this) where you can go and choose which orders to activate. They range anything from ""kill 500 enemies"" to ""win a TDM match"". Now, each ""orders"" grants a different reward (e.g XP reward, lootboxes, rare lootboxes, crafting materials), you can see what reward are tied to each ""orders"". They come in daily (24 hours) and weekly (7 days) cycle which will refresh and load new ""orders"". Upon completing a challenge, you have to go manually redeem it (HQ or loadout section). [i] [b] IF YOU DON'T IT DOESN'T REGISTER AND YOU LOSE YOUR POTENTIAL REWARD WHEN IT REFRESHES NEXT CYCLE [/b] [/i] (subject to change imo).

- Crafting materials? Yes, like Overwatch, you get crafting materials (armory cred) through various means (e.g dupes from boxes, challenges, hourly/daily ""mail"" which gives you some amount of free crafting materials) which you can use to buy stuff and rank/prestige perks this which lets you buy weapon/class upgrades stuff. You can [i] technically [/i] buy your way to unlock every weapon, perk and streak specials) via lootbox free exp (each rank gives 1 rank point)

- Everyone can see what you get if they're around you, and any [i] Epic [/i] quality stuff that was unboxed in the HQ (you have to unbox it in the HQ as far as I'm aware of) will be announced on the bottom left as a text (e.g Unforseen Lemonquences has unboxed an Epic item!)

- When you open a box, nobody can ""steal"" it (since its considered opened the moment you decide to open one in a sub menu). But they [b] CAN [/b] troll you by blocking your screen (standing between your character model and lootbox), thus preventing you from taking screenshots to showcase what you got.",41316,2782,76561198033664000,47,31.85 hrs
524220,NieR:Automata,2/20/2018,False,"Most games get bombed on for their performance and the ratings reflect that as a warning to potential buyers. But not with NieR. Instead most of the fanbase has turned a blind eye to the poor framerate issues, crashing, full screen issues, cutscene loading problems, and a numerous other glitches that could have been ironed out easily with a patch.

And that's the biggest problem of all. There is no offical patch. Not one. After all this time Platinum Games have made no effort to fix the game with a patch. Instead the task fell to the communitys hands. And god bless those patient souls who put out custom made patches to fix this game. But even for all their effort, even the community couldn't fix this PC port, and many problems persist that leave a bitter taste. 

While many are giving the game a free pass and a recommendation out of love for this excellent game plauged by performance problems, I think it's only fair that some players like me, should do the opposite. As much as I love it, I do not recommend this game on PC if you own a PS4 Pro or a XB1X. If you own the base versions of those consoles, or don't own them at all, the PC version after mods will perform well enough. But at the end of the day, it doesn't deserve the near unblemished praise or abundance of recommendations it's currently getting.

Patch your games Platinum! After all the work you've done for this amazing game, NeiR Automata especially deserves it!

275850,No Man's Sky,8/12/2016,False,"Overhyped, poorly optimized, indie game made by 15 people, being sold for AAA price. It's shallow, empty, repetitive and boring. Their 18 quintillion planets are just a bunch of re-color of the same assets, randomly generated with different combinations. Their representation of the universe is inaccurate, every single planet and moon i've seen is inhabited with life and/or vegetation, there are no gas giants, no ring systems. Also, black holes are literally portals. So astronomy enthusiasts, beware, if you thought this would be a space sim you're wrong, it is vaguely based on the real universe. 

About the gameplay, you scan stuff, you mine materials, find some outposts, fill out your ship and your gear, run out of inventory space, go to the nearest space station, sell your sh*t, and then you move on the the next planet. That's basically what you do until you reach the center of the galaxy for a NG+. About the combat, the ground and space shooting are mediocre at best. All planetary outposts and space stations look the same. There is a very limited variety of NPCs, there is 3 different intelligent species you can interact with, the same 3 guys with different clothes basically, all NPC interactions are essentially the same. All ships look like toys. And all alien life forms look like they were made by a child using Spore creature creator. The excitement lasts for about the first few planets, then the repetition sinks in, and you're left with a feeling of huge disappoinent.

I have completed the Atlas Path and completed all achievements, i'm on my way to the center of the galaxy, but i'm not sure if i will continue, because i'm already bored of the game. UPDATE: I have now reached the center of the galaxy after 14 straight hours of warping only stopping on planets to recharge the warp drive. I ended up in the Hilbert Dimension, the second galaxy. Uninstalled the game. DO NOT BUY, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Also, what i really want to talk about is how they straight out lied about it being multiplayer. And the game simply does not look like it did on the trailers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8P2CZg3sJQ

The problem is not the fact that you can't see or interact and play together with other people, it's the fact that they said it was possible and it isn't. I'm perfectly fine with the game not having multiplayer, i play single-player games and i enjoy them. What i have a problem with, is they straight out lied about it being multiplayer, that is unacceptable, a game developer cannot do that and get away with it. 

I am sick of these vague as f*ck tweets from Sean Murray implying something but not stating it clearly. It's just a series of shady moves they make over and over again, careful choice of words leaving multiple interpretations, misleading disinformation. Not even the press knows what to make of it. 

They actually covered with a sticker the multiplayer icon from the PEGI score on the Limited Edition box. Sauce: http://www.pcgamer.com/no-mans-sky-limited-edition-box-has-online-play-icon-hidden-under-sticker/ After years of clearly stating that it was multiplayer, ONE DAY BEFORE the PS4 launch, they tweet that the game is not ''a multiplayer experience'' then tweet that ''The chances of two players ever crossing paths in a universe this large is pretty much zero'' contradicting the previous tweet. 

Sean Murray specifically said on interviews you could see and interact with other players, and play together. Then on the first day it has been confirmed by two streamers that tried to meet up, they were in the same system, same planet, same spot, and couldn't see each other, for one of them it was day time, for the other one it was night time. And the kicker? Hello Games are celebrating that ''two players encountered each other'', and then say that they were having server problems, implying that's why the players couldn't meet. How can they be so deceitful?

Do not buy this game. This should be in Early Access and it is worth $20 max. I honestly don't understand the mentality of ""Give them some time. Eventually be good."" Sorry but if the game's release price is $60, it should be worth $60 at release. This is not a beta or a Early Access, although it looks and plays like one, this is a full release.

377160,Fallout 4,11/10/2015,False,"tl;dr
Fallout 4 is a huge leap backwards from Skyrim in every regard. Its not a bad game per se, but keep your money until next year's chrisas. The modders will have to work double shifts to finish this console port.

With the exception of the first ten minutes and what you saw in the trailers, this review is spoiler free.


The Pro's:
---------------
* there's a lot of Fallout in here
* modding support should be decent since its based on the Skyrim engine
* the combat feels fluid enough for a RPG
* ironsights for most guns
* VATS now slows down time instead of pausing the game (I like it)
* so far no gamestopping bugs except for constant crashes when I exit the game
* borderless fullscreen mode
* Apple/Android app is a nice touch for people who like to have the map open at all times, it works for me
* animated hair (PhysX?)
* not a single CTD so far
* Achievements not working (one of the stupidest reward methods ever conceived), Steam Overlay not working either so probably connected (Edit: Achievements suddenly started working, possibly because I started Steam in Admin Mode or they fixed something, Overlay still not working)

* Dogmeat is kinda useful now, he pins down opponents, occasionally finds loot piles and won't die five minutes after you found him (like he did in Fallout 3)
* Dogmeat goes into ""sneak mode"" when you do, looks very cute
* Dogmeat generally behaves like a ""real"" dog, he runs away from you to sniff at things, runs ahead or stays back for a bit ... he's no DD yet, but close

* conversations are much more natural than in previous Bethesda games (more than 2 actors involved, actions happening, etc,), but they're bugged to hell, more on that below
* you can move the camera arround freely during conversations and even run arround, the talker will continue to talk and wait until you focus him again to present your four response options, no more being tidally locked to a single NPC

* interesting armor system (you can strap armor on top of your armor, like shoulderpads)
* you can use the Minigun from the Power Armor without actually using the Power Armor (weird, but its Fallout)
* Ghouls have become semi-zombies, some are laying arround like a corpse until they notice you or continue to crawl when their legs are gone, try to jump & bite you without arms
* talkative enemies taunt you during combat while you fight your way to them, making the shooter part a bit more organic
* tinkering with your Power Armor feels like working on your own car

* I was sceptical about the voiced protagonist, but the female does a decent job, it will make modding quite a bit harder though
* If you play the standard female player character (the one shown in the trailers), Piper looks almost exactly like you. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but for RP-reasons I will pretend that she is my grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-niece.


The Con's:
---------------
* boring but also rushed prologue/tutorial in the most ugly environment imaginable
* yes, even more boring than the doctor's questions in F:NV
* the main plot quickly becomes completly redundant
* the forced straight marriage spouse and the baby fail to create any emotional attachment to either of them (How could they in the rushed 5 minute prologue?)
* getting the iconic Power Armor ten minutes into the game is an odd design choice
* no food/water required, a step back from F:NV
* ""Survival"" difficulty has nothing in common with survival games, not even F:NV
* Stimpacks heal limbs again, and you don't even have to target the broken one, just pop a Stimpack into your arm to grow a new foot
* not having to train skills to improve in them feels wrong

* the village building is vastly oversimplified (I demolished 3 buildings in 10 seconds, imagine woodchopping in Skyrim without ever swinging your axe) and feels like its been rushed on top of the game for feature creep
* the village building quickly becomes a chore thanks to the ridiculous UI
* still the same outworldy ""hacking"" of computer terminals (guess 4 times, then get locked out, although this time you can retry after 10sec), reminds me of Sudoku

* C-movie quality conversations, at least during the first hours, it gets better the moment you meet Piper but they continue to feel forced and out of place
* Bethesda took the easy way out of the problem with followers stabbing you in the back, get a perk that disables friendly fire damage, no need to teach Piper *not* to use that Fat Man next to you
* after spending a few hours with my protagonist, its beginning to feel like she has a split personality, mine (during normal play) and hers (during conversations), extremly limited conversation options are not helping here either

* holstered weapons disappear from existance
* enemies fall out of the sky, Dragon Age 2-style
* enemies regulary get stuck, jitter arround, generally bug out
* legendary enemies are pretty meh (""Legendary Bloatfly"" ... uh-huh)
* cars still got built-in nukes that go off if you look at them funny (it's okay if you like it, I don't)

* extreme loading times even for small buildings, SSDs are a huge help, but still
* tons of loading screens in general, an engine out of its time
* ugly, washed out graphics, it could be my imagination but I remember Fallout 3 to be prettier and less cartoon'y for its time
* FPS rollercoaster, even though my Skyrim runs at constant 60 FPS with 2K textures
* don't even try to compare Fallout 4's landscape to Skyrim, it will make you weep (not talking green meadows, just detail and aosphere)
* wax museum character models

* gigantic, oversized console UI (as usual)
* literally the most unintuitive UI controls for a PC game of all times, Bethesda tried really really hard to pi** off PC players this time, this goes especially to the Pip-boy handling
* EVE Online character creator with bonkers Gamepad-turned-into-Keyboard controls
* dialogs only offer four responses with one trying to be extra-witty, like those dumbed down Bioware RPGs
* talent tree looks pretty and funny, but also unnessecarily bloated (pro tip: you can scroll down!)
* most weapons take up a quarter of the screen, I'm not even talking about rocket launchers, just pistols

* loot menu pops up everywhere and ruins immersion, no more opening boxes to see what's inside, especially distracting in combat
* talking to sleeping people sometimes makes them stand up immediatly, instead of waking and getting up
* NPCs happily block your way in the best of Bethesda's tradition
* NPC AI seems to be from the 90's, melee's happily run into minigun fire with a pocket knife, grenades are generally thrown at walls in front of them (incinerating themselves instead of me), animals blindly charge avoid of all fear, etc. pp.


Edit: Figured out the console keys on the german keyboard. Its AltGr+√ñ.


About the missing ACHIEVEMENTS, you may want to google it before falling back to kindergarten insults. My Steam Overlay is not working either and its a known problem. One of many.


About the marriage paragraph, let me quote one comment:
""Kaiser Fred VIII
The fact that you are forced to have a wife isn't a problem of social justice or whatever, the problem is that it forces a backstory on your character. It isn't yours anymore. You can't be a socially recluse engineer living alone, or some widowed businessman or whatever. You *have* to be a married vet with a son. It is not *your* character, it is Bethesda's character. That, combined with a voiced protag, pretty much killed any prospect of replayability and RP in this game to me before I even got my hands on it.""



I think I will stop playing Fallout 4 soon and wait for the modders to eventually fix this console port. Thanks for all the comments, especially the kindergarten-level haters.

Game of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.

Game of the year for everyone else? Maybe!

Let me tell you some things about this game:
+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)
+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump
+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design
+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them
+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you
+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful aospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely
+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area ""The City of Tears"" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive

My real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.

Fot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!",97239,9521,76561198041425500,13,31.13 hrs

For now my review is going to focus on the 'mixed' user review. If you spend the time to review the negative reviews you'll find a common theme. 'Boring' and 'massive download'.

The download file is indeed massive, it's a large game. The updates are big, the game is big, even patches seem to be fairly large. So come into the game with the expectation you're going to spend a bit downloading before you can play. This should rule out about 50% of the negative reviews.

The other 30% of negative reviews come from a general theme of 'boring mmo'. As we all know, or at least should know, a lot of time and effort goes into the ambience of the Elder Scroll games. The small side stories, the heart, the emotion around the play. The entire game is like a massive novel, there is some reading to be done and a lot of voices to listen to. I would strongly suggest that for those of us who want to get involved with a great story and fantastic lore, play this game.

If you're looking to rush and skip all dialog and just run between point to point to grind missions of course it's going to be boring. You're purposely skipping the content just to level up. Don't do that, then say the game was boring because you purposely made it boring.

The reviews for graphics, gameplay, physics, etc are all great. The game feels like Skyrim and the other ES games and in my opinion does a great job of bringing it online.

In short don't let the 'mixed' reviews fool you. The true reviews are the positive ones. Most negative reviews focus only on the file size and how grinding is boring. Don't let those fool you.",39657,1382,76561198097528900,31,30.95 hrs
379430,Kingdom Come: Deliverance,2/13/2018,True,"Here's what to expect from this game. It's all about realism, and immersion. If you're looking for sword play and gameplay like Skyrim, this isn't the game for you. But if you're looking to immerse yourself in the 1400's in a time where brutality and chivalry stood apart like two brothers in line for the throne. This is the game for you. 

You'll be thrust into a game unlike any other. Hunger, thirst, and your every day life will wear you out. Where your actions, responses, and daily life will determine who you are. WHere people will treat you for what you wear, and how you talk. This is a true RPG. 

You'll quickly notice through the beginning that the devs threw off the shackles of modern stereotypes. The Princess isn't always beautiful. The Girls are not always lookers with perfectly polished faces. The men and knights are not always burly, with egos to match, and voices of heroes. They are folk like you, who have a history like you. They find themselves in their place in life for various reasons, and choices they made. They were like you once, and you are Henry, a boy coming to man hood with many roads he can take. Which will you? How will the people see you? Which lords will know you, if any? Will you be seen as a respectful knight, or a shady vagabond best kept at a distance? 

Open World RPG has a new master. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Depth Details: 

This game is all about realism, and immersion. I can't stress this enough. Many complaints by people are because their expectations of sword fighting, sounds, and aosphere come from fantasy, hollywood, and games like Skyrim. ALl of which are 2% realistic, 98% fantasy. 

Sound Effects: 
Easy place to start. The sound effects. Hitting a persons shield, or armor makes a realistic sound. Not a sound like a hammer hitting a thick piece of metal. It's realistic. It doesn't have ""impact"" or high sound effects. 

Arrows shooting through the air is what you'd expect. No overboard ""whoosh"" sounds. You'll probably hear nothing, and only a slight ""thud"" if you're very close to where it hit. Its realistic. 

Movement while wearing heavy armor is cumbersome, slow. While wearing cloth, leather, or a mix of them will allow you to move easier, swing faster, etc. This is again realistic. Wearing Cloth, under leather, under a gambit, under chainmail, and finally a plate over all of that is going to be extremely restricting to your movements irl, as well as the game. 

Armor: 

This brings me to the armor system. Layers upon layers, and you choose! Unlike Skyrim, or other games. You odn't just buy a pauldron, or chest piece, equip it, and gg. No sir. YOu choose whats under that, and under that. Just like in real life. 

You choose the type of armor ontop, and what you wear under that. Chain? Leather? Gambits? Or nothing? And what do you wear under that? Leather? Cloth? Its up to you! 

Perhaps you want to be a sneaky thief though, and wear simple cloth, and leather, allowing you to sneak even easier. 

Sneaking:

Which leads into sneaking, Sneaking is a 2 part thing. Being a shady thief is being a shady thief. Wearing black with a hood at night is pretty smart... but pretty stupid during the day too. You ever think watching movies like Lord of the Rings, or other fantasy movies. YOu have a thief, or no gooder wearing a  dark cape, skulking around and you thought ""Is nobody noticing this obviously shady person?"" Well The AI in this game do. 

How you stand out in a crowd in the day, and how well you blend in at night are both equally important to a never do well. 

The Common Folk: 

Which brings me to yet another incredible mechanic. How the people see you. Walk up to them in finely shined armor, and intricate jewelry they will treat you like a Noble. Talk up to you, and be more willing to bend to your will. However other nobles may not be so keen, though they will more likely treat you as their equal. While beggars, and low lifers will look at you with distrust, and scorn. 

Wearing fine clothes, and jewelry, a nice haircut, and looking like a well mannered individual? Merchants and common folk will treat you as such. They'll be more willing to negotiate, barder, and haggle. They may tell you things they wouldn't tell beggars, or nobles. 

Meanwhile, wear clothes like a beggar, sit in the streets, and get to know the needy, and they will trust you far more as one of them... 

What game has ever allowed this level of layers and immersion? 

Alchemy: 

Speaking of layers and immersion, Alchemy! 

Want to brew a potion? a drink? Then get ready to be a real alchemist.. Brewing a potion isn't just mixing ingredients, and its done gg. You must brew it properly. PUtting in mixtures in the right order, brewing it to a set time, and then and only then putting in another mixture of another ingredient.

Immersion and Realism hold supreme: 

I really can't stress enough this game focuses on realism and immersion. I may sound like a broken record always pointing that out, but it amazes me that I find myself even finding how much hand holding other games do. If you're running from a person on a horse for instance who has a bow.. you're going to die if you run straight.. everytime.. You have to dodge, weave, look behind you to see where he is, all while trying to keep your horse on the road, and manage the horse. Its realistic, and immersive. Dodging his arrows, while running for your life, because it doesn't take many arrows to down you, just like... you got it.. 

But wait there's more!: 

There's so much to this game I can't go into it all... Getting a good nights sleep is important as it is in real life. Try to negotiate while tired and you're likely to end up screwing up and making a bad deal. Just like you would if you were tired.. 

Not shine your armor or clean your outfit? People will probably look down on you for it. 

Bandaging wounds is a must, not just to ""heal"" but to actually heal and rest. Bleeding after being cut, stabbed, or poked if left unchecked will have hazardous outcomes to your health. Bandage it, and find a bed. You need to rest! 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bad: 

Honestly this game is so awesome in every respect, I completely overlook all the faults.. But of course there are some. 

The animations during conversations can be pretty bad sometimes. 

While the voice acting is pretty damn on par most of the time, you get awkward instances where a really awesome voice actor is put next to one with, well far less talent, and it de rails the whole conversation and in some instances even makes the cutscene lose its luster. 

There were some odd bugs at the start of the hgame as well, but none of which were gamebreaking. 

Finally many people are complaining about the FPS, or bad optimization. I have a failing computer. 
A 980Ti with 12GB of ram, and a failing processor, and I really only get a few jitters at most, and never during gameplay, just certain cutscenes. 

If you're one of ""those"" people that need 100 FPS and perfect frames all the time or you cry yourself to sleep at night, then buy it at your own risk, but if you're someone like me who can enjoy a game, even if it doesn't run perfect at frames higher than you could ever notice anyway (I mean seriously if you need an FPS counter to tell you how many frames you're not getting... lawls) then by no means should you pass this game up.",64355,3689,76561198041924800,67,30.90 hrs

GAMEPLAY: 
My first hour went a little like this;

""Oh this is actually a very pretty game""
""Where's all the land?""
""Look at all these crazy fish, they are so cute!""
""Wait what are you?... OHFUKMAN GET AWAY FROM ME""
""GET OFF MY ARM YOU SQUID WORM LEECH LOOKING THING""
""WHY IS EVERYTHING TRYING TO KILL ME??""
""This looks like a safe place... HOLY SH*T WHERE DID YOU COME FROM???""

This game takes all of your fears of the deep dark ocean and puts them on steroids, every time that little thought crosses your mind that your survival chance can't get any worse, it can and it will. It's almost like this game runs on your ""I hope this doesn't happen"" thoughts. 

STORY:
The whole plot of the game is one of the biggest area's still being worked on, it's more focused on gameplay and mechanics at the moment. I have to say though, the general background and lore of the game is very interesting and i'm excited to play through it when it's finished.

PERFORMACE:
First off, when you read all the reviews about the crashing and ""needing a beast computer to play"" isn't true at all. I have never had a crash, none of my friends have ever crashed, and if you really can't run this game at a playable FPS then you probably need to stop trying to use a baked potato for a graphics card. This game is put together far better than most fully released games i've seen. Yes, my framerate isn't pushing 80-120fps BUT considering my laptop is about 3 years old and I still manage 30-50fps on a gorgeous game like this is amazing.There really aren't any serious bugs, the most you really run into is like a light glitch or maybe a fish getting stuck in the ground, nothing game breaking. The mechanics and actual gameplay are FANTASTIC, I have to give the dev's credits for a real original survival game (since almost every one of them now-a-days are about the same with either zombies, cannibals, or just nature; but underwater alien horror survival? That's new). 

I HIGHLY recommend this game and if you actually read this shitty review, i'm sorry I suck at this. Just buy the damn game, it's worth every penny and you'll enjoy the hell out of it.",86870,6329,76561198068130900,3,30.82 hrs

edit:
So they fixed my main issue with the game in the latest patch. After looking at all the patch notes for the last few updates, it seems like the devs are doing a pretty good job trying to fix the game as rapidly as possible which is good, though on the other hand this sort of stuff should not have existed at launch.

All in all, it is a good game which is kinda clunky right now. There's still work to be done and not all of it makes sense, but it is a really great melee fighting game. I think all things considered the $30 price tag is a little steep and I would say $20 is much more fair a price. I am still not switching to recommended for this review though since I don't think it's actually worth this current price until this game is actually done being fixed.

edit2:
This is basically my only review on Steam that got any traction and I realize now that allowing comments on here is like opening up the YouTube comments section so I'm getting rid of that. 

To answer what was posted though:
1) I did not request a refund and I don't plan to. I wanted to when I posted the first review but since they are fixing things quickly I'm willing to hang on to it and wait it out.
2) I am not recommending it on here because I don't recommend it to my friends irl. I think they should get because I want to play it with them but I also think it's overpriced and if I didn't already own it would be waiting for it to go on sale.
3) If you feel the need to brag about how much money you spend on games then you're probably going to feel just fine about buying this at full price. I'm not saying nobody should buy it, I'm talking about whether it is currently a worthwhile purchase compared to other items at the same price. I don't think it stands out in the $30 category.",96360,2044,76561198119385900,7,30.27 hrs

379720,DOOM,5/13/2016,True,"The single player campaign of Doom has exceeded all of my expectations I initially had toward it. My expectations were that I wanted it to be a great FPS game, and more importantly, a true DOOM title. I started the game on Nighare difficulty right off the bat.

You will be fighting in the first 10 seconds of the game. Combat is challenging and very fluid with emphasis on speed, which they've certainly cranked up. Stopping is death on nighare. Glory kills are satisfying, can be a ammo saver, and really don't hinder game flow at all, and can even be upgraded to perform faster (or toggled off in the options).

Level design is absolutely impressive. This was my biggest concern with Doom, and rest assured id FINALLY did it right. Non-linear, lots of exploration, plenty of secrets with hidden guns, secret level unlocks, and equipment.

The monsters are relentless. On nighare you will get your ass kicked. This is a fact, and there's no way to circumvent this. I honestly felt at times that I was playing Project Brutality on ""Last Man on Earth"" difficulty. Monsters boast a variety of attacks, chase you down, flank you, and can be tough as nails (sometimes a little too good).

Weapons look and feel satisfying, great attention to detail. You will use guns interchangeably, each has their respective uses. You'll have to search the environment for health and ammo, aside from the chainsaw kills on enemies, they drop little items- but enough to keep you going (i.e +5 health occasionaly or like 4 shotgun shells). The BFG literally clears an entire room in one shot, and I couldn't help but smile at the results. Upgrades and progression in this game are entirely optional, but really help shift the game to fit how you play (the air control ability is the best imo).

The graphics are incredible too, although you better have a strong card if you want to play on Ultra with anti-aliasing, etc. Uncapping framerate, setting your FOV to 130, tons of options to customize.

And I have to say, Mick Gordon's soundtrack in this game is some of the best I've heard in a while. On the third level, I was literally head banging and rocking out to a soundtrack that felt like a crossbreed between Lamb of God, Celldweller, and Rage Against the Machine.

Overall, I can confidently say that this is the Doom game we've wanted. We all can breath a sigh of relief now that the main portion of the game is actually well-done. That beta we played is absolutely no indicator of how the campaign plays in the slightest, and id did it right with this one. Definitely recommend this title as a gamer, a die hard Doom fan (still play the classic to this day), and FPS fanatic.

EDIT: Since some of you do not take the time to actually explore the game's options and like to jump to conclusions, you can in fact start the game on nighare. Ultra-nighare is unlocked after beating the game, NOT regular nighare. Fact.",18982,2695,76561198007746500,12,29.67 hrs

PROS:

Artwork.
Voice acting.
Funny.
Turn-based made fun.
World exploration.
Co-op, both local and online!
Daily leader board with rewards (replay value).
World seems to have 'pick up or ignore' side quests.
Capturing new recruits to join your team is currently my favorite part.
The weapon and shield choices are great, and hilarious! Spatula for a sword, large piece of bacon for a shield, lol!

CONS:

Main storyline is limited to only one, really awesome btw, quest once the tutorial missions have been completed.
Sound track is VERY limited at this point, and music can get repetitive.
There needs to be about 20 more monster types added for capturing and battle variety.

CONCLUSION
Great game that's worth a buy already. Made by a team you can trust to see the project through to the end and finish with a great product. Highly recommended, worth it for the laughs alone.

[b]Review contains minor spoilers you probably know about, nothing related to the ending though.[/b]

[b]TL;DR Edition:[/b]
The game is great fun until you complete collecting Atlas Stones. After you complete that objective, it becomes tiresome just travelling to the center, which is extremely annoying to grind and will require you to go through over 100 black holes. While the game is extremely unique and the fun I experienced in the first 24 hours, it becomes repetitive. Buy it when it's ¬£20 or less.

[b]Too Long; Still Going To Read Edition:[/b]
This game offers an experience like nothing I've ever played before. Endlessly going to new planets and star systems has been one hell of a ride and journey for me. These planets really do have real variety to them, I've seen so many different mixes of terrain, as well as the species. The game really is something special and unique, but in a world so massive and randomly generated, how can Hello Games allow No Man's Sky to become repetitive for the user to play?

No Man's Sky works off the idea that you need to get to the center of your galaxy. It doesn't tell you how to do it, it just gives you a ship and a multi-tool to work with and away you go. This idea is actually a great concept, it allows the player to come up with their own story, their own objectives and make decisions on what to prioritise doing. So you eventually fix up your ship and you are starting your journey. Now, at the beginning, you are asked if you would like the help of the Atlas, which will allow you to then join the Atlas Path and collect Atlas Stones, which are used later on in the game, which for me, was my main priority. So from that point on I spent 20 hours going planet to planet, system to system, learning as much about the species that inhabited these worlds, while also building up to my goal collecting Atlas Stones and I was loving it. 

But then I got all the Atlas Stones I needed and it was laid out for me, get to the center. This was it, the final objective, the last task this game had for me. I crafted warp cell after warp cell, going through countless black holes in a race to get there before anyone else could. But by the time I travelled through 15 of these black holes, I had only travelled a tiny 15,000 light years, with a frustrating 160,000 to go. This is my main problem with No Man's Sky and Hello Games. They expect you to be okay going through over 150 black holes to reach the center of the galaxy, they think it's an acceptable game element to have, when quite frankly all it does is drive players away from playing.

This is where the repetition really hits in for you as a player. You just want to reach the center, you've done everything else, you've got a good ship, a large inventory and a great multi-tool, but that doesn't change the fact you need to grind all those warp cells to travel through 150+ black holes to reach a point you're starting to lose interest in. It kills me to slam this game because I've been enjoying my time with it so much and I love it, but this final act really does kick you in the teeth and is a disappointing end, to what is a great game.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
While Hello Games have crafted one of the most beautiful looking games I've played and how they've achieved what they've achieved with 15 people is astounding. But in turn, you've created a huge environment that makes the game feel so empty. This game needs more, give me tasks to do on the way to center of the galaxy, create new stones for different races, such as Gek Stones, just to keep us busy. This game is going to be updated and content will be added overtime, but I would strongly advise waiting until this game dips to around ¬£20 before you pick it up. ¬£40 is too steep for an asking price for what you get given in such a little time of play. While the game isn't a bad game, it just needs work. And with the right time and mindset, Hello Games can make No Man's Sky one of the most memorable games to ever grace the market.

552520,Far Cry 5,3/28/2018,False,"EDIT: After playing the game to completion I feel the game more than earns it's not recommended vote from me. So, it's not just for one ""small"" detail about an extremely ridiculous and fundamental flaw in game design. The AI is retarded. There are bugs galore. It's just the same old nonsensical Farcry as every other time. Except this time, you play as a lame mute with no characterization and the ending(s) of the game just spit on you. Just stop making Farcry games Ubisoft. It doesn't seem recoverable at this point.

WARNING TO CO-OP PLAYERS:

Your co-op partner cannot get new weapons as you play the game. Weapon unlocks are for host only. If you intend to play this entire game co-operatively, then the co-op player will only be able to use starting weapons. This is an unforgivablely ignorant game design choice in an otherwise fun as hell game.


EDIT: To clarify, the primary (and only way I've found so far in) to obtain new weapons it to purchase them from vendors. The weapons available at the beginning of the game are starting weapons for each weapon type, and a few overpriced weapons with silly skins. The majority weapons are locked behind a reputation. While in coop, the coop player does not receive any reputation. This can be found on the Farcry 5 F.A.Q here: 
https://far-cry.ubisoft.com/game/en-us/news/152-304752-16/co-op-faq

The important part here reads: 
Q. What progression is not saved when I am playing co-op as a guest?
A. As the guest, your World Progression, Reputation, and Quest related unlocks are not saved once you are back to your own world.

So. As the coop player, you have to play as the host, or alone to gain these reputations in order to unlock new weapons to purchase. At 7 hours in, as a coop only player, I am not even able to purchase the slingshot that requires rank 1 reputation. It doesn't seem crazy to me to just have both players earn rank, or just have both players world and stories progress while playing together, like nearly every other coop shooter available.",80687,1540,76561197992230400,43,29.03 hrs
464920,Surviving Mars,3/16/2018,False,"Underwhelming - this is the word that comes to mind once you've spent some time in Surviving Mars.
It's less surviving mars as surviving the tedious and combersome methods that aren't provided for managing your colonists, especially as this is a colony management / city-building type title. 

Trying to get your colonists into the jobs that they are most suited for in order to garner the best bonuses and keep them happy is immensely frustrating; and honestly it begs the question how the design decision was made to forgo more robust colonist management tools. (And no, these gameplay issues should not be relegated to be solved by the modding community).

Each colonist has their own special traits, and jobs, etc, but nowhere can you see a list of these colonists in these categories or manage them accordingly. The domes allow for some granularity when controlling who lives in them, but at the end of the day you need most if not all of the same services in every dome in order to maximise their comfort and happiness; so why bother, each dome is practically a colony onto itself at that point as attempting anything more specialised is simply pure mind numbing tedium. 

""Researching"" technologies feels unimpactful and something that just runs in the background with no real reason to specialise or pursue particular technologies. Scanning territories is precisely the same process, once again, just zoom-out click a square and move on, very little Incentivisation is utilised for this mechanic.

All in all the feeling this title leaves you with is simply one of frustrating boredom, because it should be good but it's just not. There are plenty of other titles out there that do either city-building or colony management far more comprehensively, unfortunately (and with sincere disappoinment) Surviving Mars doesn't really measure up in either of these categories with enough gusto to make it special.

275850,No Man's Sky,11/22/2016,False,"I put my fair share of time in (nearly 36 hours at time of writing). I grinded out most everything. I have fully explored several planets, maxed out inventories and travelled accross countless star systems. I spent hours simply building up language database. Do you know what i have to show for it? Nothing. it was a waste of time.

To be clear, this is a beautiful looking game, with lot's of hope and wonder, that leads to absolutely nothing. I spent hours building up resources and inventories and amassing fortunes. With nothing to do with it. All that time spent learning languages, and there was no point. Anything important story-wise, is in common language. I had much hope, waiting for something to happen. It didn't. You build random items and fuels, but that's it. You can only move from one place to another, and very little changes. Buildings are virtually identical and evenly distributed on EVERY planet. You can spot them and know exactly what they are, and what they will contain. They are unbelieveably generic. Every NPC is the same. I spent hours learning languages of a particular race. 20+ building oup relations of 1 of the 3 races, so much so i was able to decipher almost the entire language in every dialogue. Do you know what I discovered? That it didn't matter. As soon as I discovered the 2nd race, it didn't matter that I didn't know a single word. They were identical. Sure they looked different a little, but every interaction was identical. There is no point to any of the languages, they amount to nothing at all. By the time you get enough to start deciphering the exact words, what they have to say is entirely useless anyway. Did you like that outpost you were at? Too bad, you'll never find it again because navigation is terrible. But don't worry, it doesn't matter because there is another outpost that is identical, just jump in your ship and fly in any direction for less than a minute and you'll find the same damn place with a different name.

This game was like the ending of the TV Show ""Lost"", lots of buildup for a complete let down. Accumulate for no reason, talk for no reason, explore for no reason. I like a grind, but you don't even have anything to show for it. You'll never go back to wherever you were, and you'll never be able to share what you find with another human being. Cool, on this planet I'm going to name everything after memes. cool. What's the point? I'll never see that planet again when i leave for the next one. I gave this game far too much of a chance, and too much of my time. Go play minecraft, at least here you can build something. Play an MMO, at least there you can talk to someone. Go play a game with any form of campaign, at least you'll get a story. NMS is like all those games, without the things that make them great. No story, no meaningful building, no social. This feels entirely like an MMO that is empty. Accumulate wealth to buy nothing of worth, to quest with no one, and find nothing of note.",43850,3967,76561198002454100,37,28.95 hrs
346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,6/5/2015,True,"I'm at a point where I'm about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it. So here goes...

I'm 32 years old. Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin, GoG, etc.

Let me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.

Make no mistake, this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues, and the server numbers didn't cover the 100,000+ players... BUT, the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.

In the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. 

For me, that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie, or AAA team.

That said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust, with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).

In all, you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.",72316,1213,76561197970322100,14,28.92 hrs

And something I'm still left wishing they did right. The game as a whole is fine, the world is beautiful and feels lived in, and the weapons are interesting and varied. And finally, co-op that isn't just single instances! However, the real kicker is that only the host gets any progression. The buddy joining you is basically an NPC. They may play with you for hours, but the moment they return to their own world, they lose everything you've done together in terms of world progression. Now, I'm not sure if this was an oversight or intentional, but it's an incredibly poor design choice. Honestly, I can't believe it made it into the final game. I hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and modifies this.

275850,No Man's Sky,8/14/2016,True,"This game is 100% exploration. Hardly any combat to speak of. Progression is more abstract than concrete. It is solitary, mellow, and a touch repetitive. It's sort of like fact checking.

This is a game you probably know beforehand if you will like it or not.

I cannot stress enough, this game is ALL exploration. If you do not like exploration, if you don't have a sense of wanderlust, if you don't get gripped by a need to know things or by an air of mystery, you will not like this game.

---------EDIT---------
First off, I would like to thank everyone who took the time to comment on my review. Everything said has been hilarious at best and interesting at worst. I've never had a review ‚Äúexplode‚Äù like this before, so this is been kinda cool for me.

Anyways, a few further thoughts in response to other people's thoughts.

On the topic of the game not running/being bugged/bad port, I haven't experience this myself. I have an Intel i5-4590, nVidia GTX 970, and 12 GB RAM and I'm running the game 1920x1080, anti-aliasing OFF, anisotropic filtering 2, texture/shadow/generation/reflection all HIGH, and max FPS 30. With those specs/settings the game literally runs just fine for me. I've experienced no crashes and no bugs. Every now and then the game will hang up a second or two went I arrive somewhere new, but that's it for me. This has been a non-issue for me personally. I cannot comment on that aspect further.

As for missing gameplay features...this is also more of a non-issue for me personally. I personally don't care if I can see other people in the universe or not. I expected this game to be solitary, so it was what I expected. Aside from multiplayer features, I don't really know what else everyone is saying is lacking from the final release. I did not closely follow the pre-release buzz (because I was going to get this game anyways), so I am not informed as to what else was promised that is not present.

Concerns about repetition in relation to limited content and procedural generation are valid. True, the pool of parts the algorithms can pick from is rather tiny indeed. Many planets have a tendency to feel samey overall, and I would say that this is the weakest aspect of the game. However, I personally am willing to accept this limitation as a trade off for the game existing in the first place. I bushed along this this topic in the review above, but I will elaborate a little further: Exploring places that feel similar is a bad thing, yes, but I do not find this to be the focus. The focus is more abstract. I feel this game is more about exploration ITSELF rather than the results of the exploration.

Arguments about resource management I would say are half valid. From my experience so far, the resource gather is more ‚Äúat your pace‚Äù than ‚Äúat the game's pace.‚Äù If I want to sit around on a Moon mining gold and gathering a big reserve of Plutonium, I can. If I just want to grab enough fuel to hop to the next system, I can do that too. Your ‚Äúday-to-day‚Äù resource requirements in the game are very low. You can easily get upgraded ships and multi-tools just by exploring and without ever mining for resources to sell. Even warp cells require very small amounts of resources. (50 Carbon, 100 Plutonium, 50 Heridium, 50 Zinc, and 100 Thamium9 in total if you make it from scratch. For reference, your suit's inventory slots have a maximum stack size of 250.) And with just a few upgrades to the multi-tool, mining is very fast. Furthermore, this game is secondarily a survival game, and resource management is an important aspect of survival gameplay. I do not see any problem with the resource system in game, since I feel like this is exactly what would happen in the world of No Man's Sky: decentralized harvesting/production of goods due to extremely advanced technology that allows individuals to be nomads and just grab elements they need to manufacture goods they need directly.

In close, I am still enjoying this game, and I anticipate any aspects will be fixed and expanded upon within the coming months. That said, if Hello Games DOESN'T get the PC port better optimized, then at least half the criticism leveled at them will be totally valid. Also, if they don't add more content, then I will certainly be disappointed. I do agree that $60 feels steep for a game ‚Äúa mile wide and an inch deep,‚Äù but I myself personally paid full price as an way of ‚Äúpaying forward‚Äù further development and because I was very excited for an exploration game that veered more into hard sci-fi.",35674,2321,76561197974356000,15,28.50 hrs

EDIT: Here is my review for those complaining there isn't one here. But before that I just want to say my initial review was to point out that, devs are people. They make mistakes. There was a small issue causing this bug and that you should have waited it out before kneejerking it to the review page, give people the benefit of the doubt before you condemn them - especially after only a couple hours of release. The issue I had was patched within hours of release. Now, if the game was STILL unplayable, I might march to a different tune. But don‚Äôt be so damn negative right off the bat people, life is much easier if you're an optimist. Also, if you gave the game a bad review for that issue but are now crushing little dwarfs with your trolls, you might change your review :)  

Now for my thoughts: The game is amazing. I've been playing Total War games since 2005 and this is by far the best Total War game to date. In previous TW games you‚Äôve played as humans, obviously, and while this is cool to be historically accurate, what it meant was that all the playable factions were basically some variation of the other with differences in culture. In TW:WH, each faction is COMPLETELY different. The tactics you learned as the Empire will NOT hold when fighting as the Vampire. Plus, each faction has their own campaign aspect, the Empire can appoint Lords to offices that give bonuses, the Vamps have to have lands be corrupted before entering them, otherwise they take attrition, the Dwarfs have a book of grudges that each grudge has to be ‚Äúsettled‚Äù, and the Greenskins have to maintain a level of ‚Äúfightiness‚Äù within their armies or else they start in-fighting and take attrition. What all this means, is that when you start a new campaign, it feels like a whole new game almost. 

Also, the UI in this game is a MASSIVE improvement over Rome II and Attila. Now you can understand what buildings you need where to get what. Gone are the days of going down the rabbit hole of the building browser trying to figure out what does what and how it will all play out. The message system is sooo much better. Many times in the prev TW games you‚Äôd start a turn and have to click through 4-5 pop up messages then there would be 10 more side ones to go through. They‚Äôve boiled it down to what's important and overall I think have hit the right balance between complexity and depth and learnability. After all, this is nowhere as deep as like EUIV or Civ 5, but its similar, I mean the point of this game is to get more armies to smash other armies.

Now for the battles, HOLY SHIT THEY ARE AWESOME. The feeling of watching your Demigryph Knights slam into the back of an unsuspecting unit of little Dwarfs and watching them fly through the air cannot properly be described in words. Where TW has sort of simplified the campaign, they added complexity to the battlefield. No more of the rock, paper, scissors formula of the old TW games where spears beat cav, cav beat swords, and swords beat spears. Now you have flying monstrous units, trolls, undead armies that can pop up from the ground, gunnery, infantry,  giant comets of magic that rain from the sky and hexes that curse your men.I feel like some of the magic will need some balancing especially since magic damage does not scale with unit size. But over all battles are awesome. It definitely will take some time to master but it is so much fun trying to figure it out. 

Performance wise, I think it's great, I got a GTX 970 W/ i7-6700k, and while in the campaign get a smooth 90 fps on high and 50-60 on ultra, in battle usually 75-80 on high and 40-50 on ultra with few dips, even if there are a ton of units. I've only had one game crash, but no big deal! Overall I give it a 9/10. If you‚Äôre new to TW, start here! The prev TW games are much more complicated and sometime unnecessarily. TW:WH struck the right balance and I definitely recommend it.  

TL;DR - best TW game yet. All the races feels completely different, the UI is waaay better, battles are great, challenging, and loads of fun and the game is well optimized and runs good.

Massively overhyped garbage.


TLDR:18 quintillion (that's 18,000,000,000,000,000,000) planets, but not a SINGLE ONE worth exploring and nothing to do but grind. Gameplay does not evolve, this game is entirely centered around goalless exploring. If aimlessly ‚Äúexploring‚Äù the planets in the pictures does not do it for you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 



What can you do? You can scavenge, trade, identify and name the same shit but varying colors, find blueprints, ""explore"", ‚Äúlearn‚Äù an alien language. Scavenging is... think Rust: various dynamically placed resources scattered about static terrain. No Minecraft voxel mining down to the center of a planet, just scavenging sparsely placed resources. You could attack a ship but of the 23 something systems I‚Äôve warped too, all are guarded by sentinels (think police) who arrive shortly and promptly kick your ass (I had a ship with 22 slots, T4 weapons and systems, and I killed 3-4 sentinels before a fleet showed up and b*ttf*cked me).

Is it fun? No. God no. Can have some good ‚Äúpretty‚Äù views at times but in terms of gameplay, a royal grind fest. Might be mildly interesting, or even entertaining until you play long enough to see through the thin veneer that scammed the $60 off you. Anyone who‚Äôs recommending this has not progressed far enough to realize that is all the same shit, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. They refuse to acknowledge that all the time they've spent collecting resources to go explore content farther out was all in vain as it's the game play 50 systems out is exactly the same garbage. 

There's nothing worth seeing and past 2 hours of gameplay you‚Äôll have pretty much seen it all. Lots of recycled buildings that remind me of tribes 2 graphics (the alien monoliths). The puzzles are even shamelessly recycled from a pool of 4. Planets are generic perlin noise (think minecraft pre-alpha).

I seriously question if this game was even play tested. I get the distinct feel that the devs said ""hey, its working... (kind of)... ship it!"". Bugs galore, not many game breaking bugs, beyond the alt-tabing locking game up bug, so I won‚Äôt list them but a lot are really annoying and most should have been easily spotted had this game been play tested (this should be a huge red flag).

There‚Äôs loads of annoyances for example: constant achievement screens that animate in and prevent you from interacting with anything for their duration (these come quite frequently). Furthermore this interaction-lock is carried throughout the game into the game‚Äôs GUI which is plagued with fluff animations that take a time to complete for rather repetitive actions, only resulting in further slowing you down (docking animation, trading gui animations, NPC discovery / proximity animation, blueprint found popup, etc, the list goes on for a while).

Exploring is not fun as you can either suck it up and walk (it‚Äôs a planet, so you can literally walk for DAYS). You could run, for a few seconds and become tired and have to wait for stamina to recharge. Additionally there are planets that have hazardous conditions (which you have to find shelter from after a short period of exposure). Or you can take your ship, which has a stupid launch thruster that needs to be refilled after 4-5 uses (which is every 5-10 minutes) and flying is awkward on the keyboard (this is a console port). 

Heck you might actually find a cool planet, but there‚Äôs no base building so enjoy the scenery I guess? No reason to come back. Note: the dev‚Äôs have claimed: [quote]For instance, freighters and building bases *are* coming! [url=http://goo.gl/O9p7V1]here[/url][/quote]

Inventory management blows, crafting blows. Ship controls blow, this is no flight sim. More like a ""drive your mother to the store with assisted guidance"" (you cannot collide with anything, the auto-guidance awkwardly flies you around it). Lots of bugs with this. Also, no way to look under or around the outside of your ship (cannot even pan the view). You'd think in a warp civilization they'd have external cameras so you can see what the fuck you are trying to landing on (cannot even free look while flying).

So what‚Äôs left? Nothing to do? Nothing to explore? Cannot have fun flying, cannot blow stuff up...? Well you can fly around and name stuff... I left a few solar systems named with the text of the first few pages of Harry Potter.... Eh, someone might find it and have a laugh...

Will this game get better? Depends on what you expect. [url=http://goo.gl/ISbz86] read[/url] It took the dev‚Äôs until the release date to finally give a clear, unambiguous description of what the game and what future plans they have. Otherwise, stop for a moment and consider what got us here. The dev's thought it was ok to pass this game off as a series of heavy implication and vague ‚Äúdo anything you want‚Äù type trailers, this should speak volumes as to what they consider is acceptable let alone what drives their EVIDENTLY extremely lacking standards. It's quite clear that the dev‚Äôs took a quantity over quality approach. What honestly, can we expect? Multiplayer, would go a long way to making this game a lot more interesting, but this seems to be not even on the dev‚Äôs radar....


I bought this game because I am a doctoral student working on my dissertation on procedural content generation and yes this game‚Äôs hype had me worried that NMS would be decent competition, heh. They are simply procedurally varying models from a set, pool of bases. With how things are setup, they likely will only at best, be able to add more bases. I can tell you that if their generated content looks like this, it means that their PCG engine is incredibly lackluster and in order for them to upgrade the PCG engine (increasing the quality of the content) will mean fixing the existing engine (much like the core rewrite that minecraft‚Äôs PCG engine had in alpha) and from a system design approach: If you don't have time to do it right the first time, when will you have time to go back and fix it?



[h1]Update, elaboration on game mechanics:[/h1]
I got 8 or so Atlas waypoint missions in, capped several of my milestone things, 50 or so solar systems and several hundred planets in and yup same monotonic grind.

[b]Navigation:[/b]
There is no solar system map. There is only a galaxy map (you cannot zoom in on systems to view planets). Finding a particular system is near impossible as there is no orientation or searching (just free view camera) and dust clouds obscure one‚Äôs view in map. There's no way to scan planets for resources. You have to fly to each planet and explore to find what elements each planet has.

[b]Inventory / Crafting:[/b]
Inventory is extremely annoying. Your suit and ship have a set number of slots. Any blueprint upgrades, ship components, or even component upgrades, also occupy the same inventory slots. So you are left with a constant battle of trying to retain the ores you need, while having room for essential upgrades your ship needs to fend of randomly occurring pirate attacks (which are quite difficult to run from).

Additionally most if not all non-element components do NOT stack. So say you have something that wants 4 iron plates. Well that‚Äôs 4 inventory spaces + 1 empty space (only way to access the crafting thing), which is 5 spaces you will NOT have.


[b]Upgrading:[/b]
The hunt for upgrade blueprints becomes incredibly discouraging (you ~cannot buy them, they can only be found in random containers, or offered as rewards) as you get into the higher tiers, you will find a crazy number of duplicates (and yes despite being a duplicate, you‚Äôll still be plagued with the discovered blueprint popup, every single time)

You do not expands your ships slots, you abandon it and buy a new one outright (prices go up near exponentially per slot).",62783,1523,76561197971460800,15,27.73 hrs

834910,ATLAS,12/28/2018,False,"First, I played on an ARK PvP server over 700 hours so don't anyone try telling me about ""these kind of games"". This game is broken.
The main problem is simply that there is no land. There is no land to claim, and even on the lawless areas where buildings will quickly disappear in 4 days if you do not log in, there is literally not space to lay a foundation.. on any of them. In 23 hours I managed to find one spot to lay a foundation, and when logging back in, I had been killed, the bed on my raft destroyed, so I have to respawn in the noobie areas build everything again, and the wind is going the wrong way to try getting back.
The community is incredibly toxic. In ARK there were toxic people, but this is a complete another level. The griefing is endless. People found bugs to kill others in the noobie areas, and that's all they decide to do, just grief. People spam an entire island with foundations just so you cannot place one anywhere. People will attack you as soon as your back is turned, steal from your fire brazenly. As soon as you leave your raft to explore an island, there is a very good chance some asshole will destroy the bed and box - just because they can - by the time you get back.. Then because you need a foundation to build a bed, and cannot build a raft outside of the noobie zones, there is nothing you can do but die, spawn in a noobie zones, spend hours building a new raft and sailing out to find another island just for the same shit to happen.

Also, the game is simply overpopulated for the amount of landspace. Unlike ARK, there is no-where you can hide. Each cell that holds 150 players has about the same land space as 1/40th the ARK map. Most of the islands are 50+% dead space, sheer mountains that you cannot climb. This means, other than the aformentioned problems, there is absolutely no potential for solo play, absolutely no potential to hide somewhere out in the sticks. If you manage to lay a foundation somewhere, you're going to have 30 immediate neighbors, and amongst them is guaranteed to be dickheads who will fuck with you as soon as they can.

814380,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,7/16/2019,False,"Now before I get started, I gotta make some things clear. I beat the game, I didn‚Äôt like it, yes I am a Soulsborne player, no that‚Äôs not why I didn‚Äôt like Sekiro.

Also before I get into the problems I have with Sekiro, I will list the things the game did well.
-Setting
-Story
-The way you can influence the story
-Lore
-Visuals
-Sound design
-Music
-Movement system
-Controls

Now I will talk about the things the game did badly, from bad to worse.

[b] 1. The Stealth System. [/b] It‚Äôs so shallow. We‚Äôve seen great stealth systems in other games like the Baan Arkham games, where enemies would change how they act depending on the situation. If they knew you were in the area, enemies would be cautious and take offensive or defensive action, and they would even panic if you took out all their buddies, or they got separated from the group.
Sekiro enemies on the other hand have two states: default state, and attack state. Unless you are noticed, the enemies will remain in the default state. If you get noticed, all the enemies within earshot will come running at you in the attack state, but if you simply jump or grapple up to the rooftops and stay out of sight for a few seconds, the enemies will lose interest and go back to the default state, resuming their original positions. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much carnage you‚Äôve unleashed, they‚Äôll just forget about it and let you stealth kill them again.

[b] 2. The Camera. [/b] While some of the problems with the camera also apply to the Soulsborne games, it‚Äôs particularly vile in Sekiro. The camera snaps to the direction your character is facing, this is typical in these types of games, but it can cause an annoying issue, especially in boss fights. You‚Äôll be trying to lock on to the enemy, but the camera keeps snapping away, and sometimes it feel like you have to be facing the enemy in order to efficiently lock onto it. This can get you killed. Another problem is the grappling depends on the camera angle, leading to some nonsense where you jump towards a grapple point, but no matter how much you mash the grapple button, you plummet to your death because you didn‚Äôt position the camera just right... Also if you are up against a wall or cornered in a fight, you can‚Äôt see anything.

[b] 3. The Replay Value. [/b] From Software is notorious for making games with astronomical replay value. Tons of different playstyles, weapons, magic, challenges, and multiplayer to boot. Sekiro has none of these things. There is only one playstyle, one weapon, no magic, no multiplayer, most of the skills are useless, and only a few of the prosthetic tools were worth using. This leaves the player without much of a choice in how they play through the game.

[b] 4. Dragonrot. [/b] The more you die, the more NPCs get afflicted with a disease that prevents you from continuing their quests, and they can only be cured by using a very rare and limited item. I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain why this was a terrible decision.

[b] 5. The Combat System. [/b] It‚Äôs clear that From Software wanted to have a different combat system for this game rather than recycling the Soulsborne combat formula yet again. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, however it had poor results. You see, the entire combat system revolves around building the enemy‚Äôs posture bar in order to deliver a death blow. How do you do this? You attack, and you deflect. That‚Äôs how you beat the overwhelming majority of the game‚Äôs bosses. In order to get players focusing on attacking posture rather than health, they gave all the bosses a ridiculous amount of health, cut the amount of dodge iframes in half compared to the other games, made the bosses track you like they‚Äôre standing on a record player while attacking, and take off half your health every time you get hit by most of the early bosses. But since the enemy posture bar depletes so fast when their health is high, their health bar is usually really low by the time you break their posture and deliver a death blow, defeating the point of the posture bar and the high health all together. But to make it so really good players couldn‚Äôt destroy the bosses in seconds, they made it so you had to kill the bosses twice in a row, three times in some cases.
All this creates a combat experience where you only need to press two buttons in order to win. Attack and deflect. You don‚Äôt even have to have great timing, either. So long as you tap the deflect button at least half a second before you get hit, you get a successful deflect. Mashing deflect is less effective, but you can still succeed with mashing if you REALLY mash it. This overly simple system is subverted by two things. Perilous attacks, and flat out bullsh** attack patterns (which I will get into later). The perilous attack are unblockable and mostly undeflectable. This mixes things up a bit, but there is a massive problem. You get a big bright red symbol to tell you that a perilous is coming, but it doesn‚Äôt indicate which type of perilous is coming, and the game is so fast paced already that by the time you see the indicator, you have almost no time to look at the enemy animation to tell what action you need to take, that you really can‚Äôt make effective counters or evasions unless you‚Äôve already been victim to that enemy‚Äôs attacks many times.
TL;DR, the combat system railroads you into a repetitive and overly simple fighting style.

[b] 6. The Bosses. [/b] Fighting the bosses in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is uneventful at best, and a chore at worst. Fighting the regular enemies makes you seem like a highly trained shinobi, easily able to cut down any in your path, as most of the enemies in the game can be defeated by spamming the attack button, with few exceptions. But fighting the bosses is completely different. They have massive health pools, massive posture bars, do so much damage to you (especially in the early game), usually have to be killed twice in a row, and often have attack patterns that are genuinely unfair. The fact that bosses are copy-pasted repeatedly throughout the game doesn‚Äôt help Sekiro‚Äôs case.
Let me elaborate on the attack patterns being genuinely unfair. Many of the bosses have attacks that start and finish faster than a human being can reasonably react to without specifically watching for that specific attack. These attacks usually have such subtle tells, or even no tell at all, and it doesn‚Äôt help that these attacks often follow the Sekiro tradition of doing absurd amounts of damage. The average human reaction time is 250 milliseconds, that translates to 15 frames in a 60fps game, and any attack animation that starts and finishes in less than 15 frames is bordering on cheap. Granted, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne have that same attack problem, but at least Bloodborne gives you a way to deal with it that‚Äôs fun and makes it a fair challenge. This kind of nonsense in Sekiro turns many fights into sort of a Mexican standoff prediction and twitch reaction game, even if you know the boss in and out. The reward for beating these slog fests is being able to continue the game, and maybe a minor attack boost or 1/4th of a health and posture increase. 
Personally I only like Guardian Ape and Divine Dragon, though the latter only for the spectacle and lore.

[b] Conclusion: [/b] I tried really hard to like Sekiro, and there is a lot to like. But unfortunately it left me bored and unmotivated. It‚Äôs not often I find a game that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone, but Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is one of them. It made me less interested in the upcoming Elden Ring. It‚Äôs unfortunate. If you like the game, more power to you, I‚Äôm glad you do. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to enjoy it. I finished it just so I could feel credible enough to write this review. Thumbs down.

So, let's start off with some facts about the PC port:
[list]
[*] It supports arbitrary rendering resolutions [b]and[/b] arbitrary framerates. Big bonus point here.
[*] It has built-in support for supersampling.
[*] It has decent PC controls, and pretty complete remapping support.
[*] The UI and 2D graphics are all provided in high resolution!
[*] It adds dual audio, which is very nice.
[*] It performs well enough, though not as well as it should. But in practice, when you get 120 FPS, that doesn't matter much.
[*] No 21:9 support though, and it looks like the in-game videos weren't available in decent quality sources anymore.
[/list]So, if you already know you'll the game and just want to know about the port -- get it, it's well made and worth the price.

[h1]The Game[/h1]

If you don't know about the game itself, I'll try to explain. Persona basically combines JRPGs, a bit of roguelike, a bit of Pokemon, a bit of ""raising sims"" (like Princess Maker), and a bit of VNs.
Let's unpack each of these:
[list]
[*] JRPGs -- this part should be obvious. The turn-based battle system, character leveling, equipment, and dungeon exploration are pretty vanilla JRPG.
[*] Roguelike -- the dungeons have randomly generated floors and change each time you visit. You also have rare encounters and drops and things like that.
[*] Pokemon -- your character can use the titular ""Personas"". You can aquire them in-game, improve them, and fuse them in a pretty neat system to create new ones. Much of the strategic interest is in preparing Personas well suited for particular battles. (Note, in terms of influence, this should really be ""SMT"", but a lot more people know Pokemon)
[*] Raising Sims -- the entire game is based around a calendar. On each day (and sometimes time slot), you can decide what to do. This can be anything from studying or working various side jobs over hanging out with other characters or eating out to actually going to a dungeon. All of these activities can influence, and are in turn influenced by, your non-battle skills (like knowledge, courage or diligence).
[*] VNs -- over the course of the activities I just described there are a lot of character stories you get to participate in, and you have quite a bit of choice in them (though ultimately the most meaningful choices you make are how you spend your time).
[/list]Take all that, combine it with a modern-day Japanese highschool + supernatural setting and extremely confident, consistent and unique overall graphical styling and music, and you get Persona.

Sadly, it doesn't always work out perfectly, and there are some pacing issues and dungeon and battle design issues, but it's also clear that there are reasons for its rather unique popularity/appeal.

After eagerly waiting for this game to come out of Early access and enjoying the concept but waiting for the full delivery, I have to say I'm very disappointed.

The promised and very hyped campaign mode looked promising in the small snippets they advertised, but in reality is the same mission over and over with the conditions increased. Build your population to 400-600-800 by Day 25-30-35, destroy all the infected, sometimes don't. Destroy the infected doom houses and build your population. All of these missions are timed, so even after you've destroyed all enemies on the map you will fail unless you've spammed enough farms for population within the time limit for a ""victory"".

People complained about the absurd difficulty of the survival mode within Early Access, and those who voiced this were told to wait for the campaign for a more streamlined experience that will ease you into the game. This is not the case. Difficulty is all over the place but not in the way you'd expect; many elements are trial and error. You either build perfectly the first time by being a veteran player, or you keep re-trying a level over and over until you get it right as there is no save feature in this game.

Infected will spawn in locations at set parts of the map without warning to the player or a horde needed, meaning you either turtle from the beginning (and lose, because you're on a timer), or you expand out, kill all zombies, think an area is cleared and zombies will spawn out of thin air to attack your base. I've made a habit of trying a level, dying after finding out where all the hidden spawn points are, and building walls around them because I now know where they are. Not fun at all.

As for the ""hero"" missions, they are literally sending your unit to walk through a map, watching him/her slowly...and I mean slowly, kill each infected one by one as you Attack Move to the end. Your objective is to grab a box and bring it back to the entrance, and so far out of the 4 missions I've played the mission has been the exact same each time. There are no abilities (outside of consumables you can pick up) and very little thought process for this, just A click and watch your character slowly one shot each zombie...and they are billions. Worst still is there are collectables to find in these levels, but somehow they've ignored every prior RTS game that has included hidden items on levels and managed to design them without any visual cue.

Background elements may be collectables sometimes and may not be. Collectables will have no distinct visual difference to other objects in the map, and there is no way to tell what can be picked up or not unless you hover your mouse over it. That barrel texture you've seen plastered throughout the map? Out of that group of 8 barrels, 1 of them is collectable, but you'll need to hover your mouse over it to find out. This gets worse when random decals start to become collectables; a bit of chain on the floor, an identical glass bottle out of a group, and worse yet hidden collectables behind background elements, like trees, only fully visible if you disable terrain graphics.

Why care about collectables? They are your EXP to spending your talent tree, and how much resources you get in attack missions, meaning if you miss the smallest thing you are weaker for the rest of the game until you repeat that level. That leaves myself and many people on the forums complaining about spending half an hour in fully completed and cleared missions looking for the last hidden element somewhere in a giant map. Look out for the walkthroughs for this one.

There appears to be no voice acting, story, or dialogue outside of an opening cutscene. When a campaign was advertised, some sort of story was expected.

The final type of mission I've seen so far are ""horde"" missions, where your objective is to kill a set number of zombies running at your watch tower as you set up a static defence before the mission starts and see how it fares. After several attempts at this mission I was told by a developer on the forums that I should have taken a certain talent choice to be able to place spike barricades to finish these missions. This talent choice costs a lot of points, is the 4th one down on one branch, and requires a lot of invesent to take. If the mission was designed with these in mind, why are they not given to the player as mandatory? As there is no way to respec, you are virtually forced to take this, or absolutely min-max the best possible strategy I haven't thought of yet. After 9 attempts of re-designs, screenshots of zombie pattern layouts to figure out where every choke hold is coming from, and a lot of trial and error, I've come to realise that the balancing in this game is simply not there.

There are a few ""veteran"" players that are essentially shutting down complaints that have been present since the start of Early Access for this game that critique the horrible balancing telling them to git gud, but as a RTS player and huge fan myself who has tried more or less all of them and has gone through the thick and thin of different campaign ideas and evolutions, I can tell you that this isn't just a difficulty problem, but fundamentally poor design. Most RTS games ease the player into understanding fundamental mechanics and slowly unlock units and aspects so they can learn how each work at a streamlined pace, this does not. This isn't the fun type of difficulty either, but the cheap one that forces you to start over because you weren't building optimally since the very start, even at the opening tutorial of the game, leaving very little room for experimentation.

EDIT: Criticism towards their game is now also being censored as well. Their forum moderator is calling people impatient and new to RTS games, insulting them if they've only tried their game for 2 hours telling them to put more in (past the refund process) if they criticise it. What a mess.

Some will say ""You must have been having fun, otherwise you wouldn't have played it for 23 hours. Why didn't you stop after 5 hours?""

The answer to that is: Because I BELIEVED it would get better. I had faith. People kept saying things like this:

""Planets get more interesting closer to the center.""
""You just haven't given the game enough time yet. It gets better once you get more inventory slots.""
""Keep playing, I've had an amazing time.""

Lets say someone came to me and said ""Lets dig to the center of the Earth. Theres a pot of gold there and you will be rich. Heres a shovel"", and I start digging. After 10 hours I say ""This sucks. I'm going back up the ladder.""

The gentleman says ""No keep digging. It will get better. It will be worth it.""

After 23 hours of digging I'm still having a terrible time. Do I give up and say ""that was no fun"", or do I keep digging?

How about if I had paid 40 quid for the shovel?

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,2/12/2018,False,"OK, Steam asks me for a review (after I got a ""free weekend play"" offer, managed to squeeze 20 hours)...
I am an old guy (40+ yo), played Civs since Civ1, spent my teen years playing Civ2 (and 3), didn't like Civ4 much, spent over 2800 hours on Civ5 and still going (still 3 civilizations to play-and-win).
I will write this review for all Civ5 fans out there, thinking the almighty ""Is it worth it yet?"" question.

It's not. At least not yet.

What did I like:
 - refreshed government types (early goverment types unlock very few benefits, later ones more and more) - think ""they replaced Policies with it""),
 - interesting City District mechanics (still didn't fully wrap my head around it, but I only played 20h or so), making Cities physically large, occupying 10+ hexes),
 - trade routes now establish roads automatically (oh, and wokers now ""expire"" after few uses so you only use them to build farms/mines/etc but not roads),
 - Corps/Fleet idea (you can join 2-3 units of same type to create a stronger version with bigger punch; useful if you're hopelessly outgunned by tech-superior opponent, your swordsmen against his riflemen).

What I didn't like:
 - cartoonish graphics (I realize developers want to introduce 12yo's to this game, but they clearly forgot about veteran gamers), especially irritating on diplomacy screens, I don't think I will ever get used to it,
 - seems it's made for tablets, not PCs (aforementioned graphics, everything is click-click-click - not much of keyboard control),
 - reports are clunky compared to Civ5 (try to list all your military units, to see if they need upgrading etc, I dare you; try to easily see which of your cities has most production/science/...),
 - diplomacy is a joke; while I like Cassus Belli (a ""reason"" to start a war to minimize your warmongering score) it's only the player needs it, AI will be constantly starting wars with you, even if moment ago they were showing smily face (icon representing your standing with them), and then when you pummel them to dust (hey, they started!) all other AIs will start hating you for warmongering,
 - oh, and they will be denouncing you every 5 turns or so, and that's the video sequence you have to wait through (and THEN click ""OK, done""), making turns longer and longer (the ""denounce"" is used by players to start wars; it's not really used by AI for nothing else)
 - not to mention that scary Gilgamesh looks like a Asterix-or-Obelix cartoon. He was my friend for ages, and then he hated me, and then my ""free weekend"" expired to I couldn't put him to his Disney-like grave.

What is interesting but needs improving:
 - the Eureka system. Great idea (""if you use archers all the time for war, it should be much easier for you to develop crossbows""), but flawed execution. Some Eurekas are triggered by luck (""find a natural wonder to speed up research on X""), some by something-way-too-easy (""build a Niter mine to speed up research on Rifling, 3 or 4 eras (!) ahead of you""), and some are just insane (""build 3 units of this brand new thing to speed up following research"", where research takes 30 turns, and building that brand new unit takes 25 turns),
 - new World Wonders; some are overpowered (Big Ben!), some are useless (""Chicken"" Itza it's now just that, it just improves jungle tiles in this single city alone and takes 80+ turns to build, WTF?).

I know DLCs change the game. I will still wait and read reviews once every while to see if anything changed. But for now...

233860,Kenshi,1/26/2015,True,"I remember when I first got this game, back in summer of '13. I had started out with nothing but the clothes on my back, some cash, and a rusty sword. 

First thing to do was to find some buddies to help, and so I went to the nearest town. In a tavern I met a short bald man (though we were all bald back then). His name was Dirt, and this was my new best friend. Dirt and I did some pretty bad things then, luring guards to get killed by starving bandits, and then stealing all of the gear. This changed when we both got a little close one fight, and got chased by bandits all the way into the entrance of town. There weren't enough men to hold them all back, so I went into a tavern to see if anyone could help. I found a huge man, named Vedi. Vedi was willing to help for a price, and after paying him he went out there with a rusty sword and killed 3 of the bandits before he passed out from blood loss, effectively saving the town.

It was the three of us for a good, long time. We killed many a cannibal and a bandit, and soon enough came upon the idea to make our own outpost, a safe haven to keep us secure and resupply when the going got tough. There was a town nearby, so all we had to do was get a few materials here and there and after a week maybe it would be set. By this time all three of us were pretty decked out, myself having a good long coat, Vedi with a huge cleaver, and Dirt with a tricorn hat. Most cannibals were either afraid of us by this point, or dead, there wasn't much worry of our safety by now. 

We had almost finished the small base, with Vedi and I working on some some construction, so it was Dirt's turn to go get the materials. We had both finished our construction, and so had waited for Dirt to come back. A day had gone by, we were starting to get worried. By noon the next day, Vedi and I had decided to risk it and leave the base, to go see where Dirt had gone. The next town over must surely know where he went?

We didn't even make it halfway across when we found him, laying on the ground. 

His hat and sword weren't far from him, and there were two dead bandits next to him. Incisions and cuts were all across his body, bones broken and blood everywhere. Vedi cried, I stared for a good long time, before getting his hat and sword. I walked to the nearest bandit encampment, which some members looked wounded, and slaughtered them all with Vedi, after he finally caught up.

Time has passed since that day, and the small base we had thought of originally is now a bustling town, with nearly eight residents there, all dressed and ready to defend their home. These people are the best I could have asked for, and I still keep the tricorn hat as a symbol of office, with Vedi forgoeing his cleaver for that sword, as his symbol of guard captain. But as much as I love these people, and would die for them, they will never be that man whom Vedi and I came to know as our best friend.

I haven't played td 4 or 5, but noticeably different from the older ones I played is more upgrades and leveling. Instant monkeys (kind of like lootbox monkeys towers that you can instantly place) are also new to me.

Why should you make Bloons have in game micro-transactions (even if you don't actually need to partake in them). This game used to be a completely free online game - why add in monetization...

275850,No Man's Sky,8/13/2016,False,"Ok first off, this is coming from someone who knew nothing of NMS other than seeing it way back when at E3.
I was not hyped about the game, and never looked too deeply into what the game was about. Other than knowing it was a procedurally generated space sim / adventure.

So I have played a fair few hours now, 100% on the original planet and warped 20 or so times. Been to quite a few plannets and stations.

Here are my thought's, so far. Because if a game cant grip you from the start, then.....

First off when you first enter the game it looks beautiful. I like collecting all the data and i like the concept of gathering all the materials you need to repair and craft things for you and your ship. 
This is kind of the main problem of the game,Although the inventory managment seems more of an annoyance than a challenge. Having to scrap things you find just to open a box to see what is inside. Just to find out its the same trinket you just dropped. There does not seem to be anything intresting in any crate I found.
I mostly enjoyed finding the ancient alien artifacts that offer bits of story.

After the first 3 hours after I got used to my environment ""collecting"" everything became quite tedious. 
It tells you nothing of where you need to go or what you need to get.
I understand it is a sandboxy kind of a game with a small bit of story in order to call it a ""game"" But nothing from the first planet you are on pushes you to go further. 

When you are on the first planet you can not open certain boxes due not not having a V1 Atlass Pass (whatever that is). It tells you nothing of what this is or how to aquire it. I only later aquired it by randomly warping around. 

I got bored near the end of my first planet because there seemed nothing new. Yes you can fly around investigating the ? But what is the point? they are just re-colored versions of what you have already explored.

There is no ""real"" threat, this was very important to me, I wanted to see a hostile planet, where the animals hunted each other, the animals attacked you etc..
There is none of that really, the only threat you have are from the drones that are too easy to kill and usually do not even attack you unless you engage first.
You cant even kill yourself from falling off a cliff.
Danger in the game is more ""passive"" threat, I.e Radiation etc that you never die of just makes you use more of your resources.

I felt like I was playing in god mode, When you meet your first alien I would expect an interesting confrontation, but no they just sit in there chair and most of the time don't even acknowledge that a strange unknown species has just walked straight into there house. 
The conversation options with said aliens are shallow and offer nothing, the only reason to go to these places is to get a new weapon that they tend to have on the wall.

The whole ""Universe"" just seems dead and shallow. Animals that run around with no AI. Supposedly intelligent aliens that I would imagine in reality to be very rare, they are everywhere, and are as shallow as quest NPC's in an MMO.

So after leaving your first planet, you're hyped to explore a space station? a new planet?
You go to a space station that is massive and looks cool, you enter the docking port go through the door, and you're greeted by yet another ""Intelligent"" alien sat in a chair, offers nothing different than the other aliens on the planet.
Where are all the people in this space station? why is it so big? 
God knows, its just 1 dude in a chair in a little room.

So new planet?
Infinite possibility? No. I entered my second planet to find the same more or less creatures even the same models used just with different colors. 

[Edit]
I have since tried to play more to get my money's worth. And I stand by my original opinion. There is far to much of the same thing repeated over and over. You go to a new plannet and half the plants look the same, the background sounds of animals is the same for every planet. 
It says allot when the game itself is only 2.5GB of how the assets in the game are repeated.

The payoff of reaching the center of the universe by grinding through these same color shifted planets is not enough for me.

So should you buy NMS? No, not now.
Wait for if and when its an actual game.
Seems more of a tech demo right now.

What happened to the times when you bought a game, and that was it. It was a complete game.
Today when you buy a game you buy a into a concept, that they can add too if they want or most of the time just leave as it is.

Interesting mechanics such as cover are removed entirely.
The economy is ruined, with resource rates being based primarily on the current game time to try to force specific game lengths.

The singleplayer campaign is uninspiring and badly written, and with the emphasis on unit-only missions and the broken economy it doesn't even feel like a strategy game.

681660,Bless Online,5/29/2018,False,"Let me preface this with the good parts of Bless.

It's fun. I genuinely have had a good enough time playing it, that if the developers actually treated their players like customers, I could recommend it right off the bat. However, that simply isn't the case. At all.

To begin with, the game is running on DX9 (mainly due to it using UE3) only at the time of this writing, meaning that it runs like crap for a lot of people, and simply ok for the majority of others. This makes zero sense when the developer has claimed they were going to optimize the game when bringing it to the West, and yet....haven't optimized really anything at all. And this is more apparent with the fact that the game as of now, has no hardware detection built into it. You have to go into the .ini files to edit things like your CPU and do simple things like uncap the FPS, just to get it to a state that's acceptable for most people.

The text translations for everything related to your skills is so bad that myself and my girlfriend just stared at the skill tree trying to figure out what we were supposed to be leveling up, and what each of them even did. This shoddy translation goes to the tutorial, and throughout the entire game as well. You even see placeholder level up text telling you ""you've reached 2Level""....it's bad.

The game is censored so that NeoWiz could get a T rating and because of ""local laws"" in the regions they're releasing it. Which is one of the dumbest things I've heard considering the game is niche, the game is marketed to adults, tons of games on Steam have full nudity or sex scenes, the list goes on. It seems like this is another case of pandering where devs don't want anyone to be mad that there might be some nipples in a game. Oh, and they never said this upfront, people had to discover it themselves. 

The founder's pack items are character locked. I bought a Deluxe Edition for myself, made my first character, and had to delete it because of servers being so packed I was waiting 2 hours to get in. So I made a new character....and ALL of my Deluxe Edition items are gone. I sent in a support ticket on their site, which they closed and sent me a survey. No one responded whatsoever, and the devs on the forums are saying they're only looking into the Lumena being missing. Meaning all of the skins and pets, mounts, etc....gone. Thanks NeoWiz!!

The action combat for every class but Berserker has been disabled. And the devs have said on the forums they MAY re-enable it at some point. You know how action combat was one of the focal points of bringing it to the West? How they said they were fixing the combat and making it better? Me too....and then they pull this, again, without telling anyone prior to taking their money. People had to discover it.

Lastly, the developers are locking and deleting all topics that people create to simply bring up their practices. I myself have even received a warning for ""creating drama"" when I simply said that treating your customers like this will result in your game being ripped apart in reviews. Gamers aren't exactly the most forgiving, especially when it comes to their money being taken and being lied to.

It's sad, because in spite of ALL of these things, the game is actually enjoyable. I could see myself playing this as my main MMO, I could see myself spending more money on it, etc. However, with the treaent of the public by the developers, the lies, the underhanded censorship, and how every response from them is either one sentence long, or they just ignore it and delete it....I can't and won't be recommending this game to anyone right now.

Server issues happen at every MMO launch, game crashes happen, bugs happen....hell, I can forgive all of these things. But the lies and ridiculously poor treaent of paying customers is something that I refuse to just suck up and accept.

I understand this is Early Access, and they have promised to fix things. So, if they do indeed fix things as promised, and start treating the community like they matter, I will change and rewrite my review to a positive one. As of right now though, I would stay away.

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,12/19/2016,False,"[b][u]The Short of It:[/u][/b] While Civilization VI isn't a bad game, it is quite fundamentally flawed and comes in no way close to its predecessors, Civ IV and V. If you're new to the series, definitely play those instead, or if not, go for Endless Legend, why not. All three are better experiences than Civ VI.



[b][u]The Long of It:[/u][/b] The Civilization series should be well-known to all gamers, but not everyone has actually played the games. The groundlayer of the turn-based 4X-genre, Civilization takes a player, and his empire, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, with the player making decisions on where to focus in terms of scientific research, military development, cultural progress, expansion, and many other factors. Every game is different, not just in terms of player-determined settings, but also in terms of map layout, rival civs, etcetera.



[b][u]The Right of It:[/u][/b] Civ VI improves one thing greatly compared to its predecessors, and that is city development. The Districs system really forces you to think, and to specialize. Gone are the days of a single city building every improvement and Wonder. It's just not possible anymore, and that's a good thing. With the districts-system, Science and Production are no longer the be-all, end-all of games which need to be focused on primarily.

Barbarians are no longer the pointless annoyances they were in the previous games. They're much deadlier now, and every civ needs to stay on its toes. This definitely gives the barbarians-element some much needed relevance.

A few other nice improvements made it to Civ VI, including military/noncombatant escort formations (finally!), expendable builders (which deals with unit clutter), mix-and-match cultural policies, and Eureka!-boosts for techs and civics, earned by fulfilling all kinds of mini-tasks. Now, if they'd just stuck to that, Civ VI would have been a straight-up improvement over VI, but sadly, there's a lot to discuss when I point out...



[b][u]The Wrong of It:[/u][/b] With all the desire for innovation and change, Civ VI trips over itself in quite a few deparents, in same cases making the game frustrating and irritating to play.

The diplomacy system is, for want of a better word, a complete disgrace. Rival Civs will all, without exception, viciously loathe each other, including you, denouncing each other and you as often as they can, even when you've done them absolutely no wrong. One Civ had several diplomacy bonuses from good relations, but still declared me filth because we had a different system of government. Meanwhile, the A.I. leaders will not stop spamming you with pointless messages every turn, and because they, for some reason, need to slowly fade out twice, it's an infuriating habit which costs you a lot of time and has no benefit at all.

You might as well never bother with trade deals either. The AI will never, ever agree to a trade deal, nor suggest one, which doesn't favour them at least 3:1, even if they are pathetically weak. Their deals are nothing short of extortionate, and all they do is waste your time with more pointless interruptions, because you'd never, ever accept any of their deals anyway. As for espionage, well, expect all the A.I. opponents to focus only on you, sabotaging your Industrial Zones relentlessly, causing you to gnash your teeth as you waste yet more turns rebuilding things.

What few friends you have will, guaranteed, suddenly declare war on you for no reason at all, even though they're much weaker than you are and have nothing to gain from the conflict. And then, within ten turns, they'll come begging on their knees for peace. Refuse, and the entire world will hate you even more for being a warmonger. That's right, you will be a warmongering menace to the world even if you never once declare war. Having war declared on you and defending yourself is apparently an atrocity. This kind of system makes a player wonder if this game was even playtested at all.

In fact, it's not just diplomacy, really. The A.I. in general is often downright moronic.

The choice of art style, as well as the writing, are questionable to say the least. While it's true that Civ V was high on realism, and therefore seriousness, Civ VI has taken to the other extreme. The art style is jarringly cartoony, with leaders looking like caricatures and the map nauseatingly green and yellow, the UI is ugly with oversaturated colours, and the educational quotes that came with tech discoveries have been replaced with cringey pseudo-witty pop culture soundbites from comedians and other assorted funny-people. Not even Sean Bean's excellent narration can save the writing from being eye-rollingly lame. All things combined, Civ VI has the look of one of those crappy mobile games.

Lastly, the Civilipedia isn't much help. The game neglects to explain a lot of things and looking them up in the Civilipedia doesn't help one bit. You're supposed to smell that you can only build a single Archaelogist per city that has an archaeology museum, for instance. Often, building options will be grayed out without any explanation as to why. And don't get me started on National Parks. Ugh.

And of course, once more, many civilizations and mechanics are not present, or in a bare-bones way, which means Firaxis has once more held back things which were present in the previous game, only to release them in expensive DLC packs. It's a nasty habit, and every game developer should ask itself some serious questions when it resorts to deliberately holding back game content to be able to release it as DLC later.



[b][u]The Last of It:[/u][/b] Civ VI has some good ideas, but its positive elements don't come close to making it as good as Civ IV or Civ V.

304390,For Honor,2/14/2017,False,"I will soon update my review, but for now i really do not recommend the game if you dont have a beastly internet connection due to the P2P(Peer to Peer) connection but if you do? hmm... its still 50/50 because you will end up connecting to people that have slower internet connection. Then you will experience some not all of these, the lags, Disconnection(DC), a lot of  errors in connecting to GAMES and PLAYERS(so much of these), cant play with your friends if you have different NAT statuses (i hate this the most) for example your friend has yellow NAT(can connect to green and yellow only) and you have red NAT(can connect to red and green only), you will not be able to play together, for me it is like LOW PRIORITY in DOTA 2 but not the same of course. Yeah thats pretty much what the multiplayer is right now. I can say though that my internet is below average but in games like, dota 2, CS:GO, Overwatch, League of Legends, some MMOrpg's i face minimal issues. yeah thats all i could say. So Cheers guys.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. 

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. 

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

~EDIT~

A lot of people were upset I didn't share the things I enjoyed about the game in detail. Below you will find my personal experience in the short amount of time I spent playing.

I spent most of my time fighting slimes with a sword and mining the ore in the dungeon.. haha, but I also made some money off plants. I didn't spend much time getting to know the townsfolk. I got irritated that weeds kept growing in my garden, but I kept plucking them and it was sort of rewarding to keep my map weed free. That's about all I can say other than digging up treasures that would show up in the dirt. I had just planted some plant that cost me like 1000 gold, and I built a water irrigation system around that, and my other plants. It was struck by lightning shortly after... lol, my best friend actually played for several hours with me which was unexpected, and since we shared gold he and I kept screwing each other over for fun. I just saw an update that may be fixing that ""issue"" however, and either way I intend to pick up the game again and play it much more in depth when my winter season comes and work slows down.

8870,BioShock Infinite,11/26/2013,False,"Bioshock Infinite is essentially an overhyped hallway shooter. At first the aosphere and city seem full of potential, but as you proceed through the game, all of it disappears and is replaced by mixed feelings of boredom and dread. This isn't because the enemies or environment are frightening or intimidating, but because playing the game quickly goes from 'a promising Bioshock sequel' to 'tedious mob-killing chore oh god let me finish this game already'. Progress in Infinite is akin to cutting through thick vegetation in the jungle while waist deep in giant python-infested waters, only without the danger, suspense, and adventure that would come with such an expedition.

One would imagine that such a setting as a floating city would be an incredible feature on it's own, but alas, even the very world you play in falls flat on it's face and doesn't bother getting up, opting to roll awkwardly to it's destination instead. It is entirely forgettable that you're in a floating city once you begin to proceed through the game. Perhaps it's because rather than being able to explore the city and be reminded that you're miles in the sky, you end up just walking through one straightforward area filled with bullet sponges to the next. 

Where the Bioshock games allowed the player freedom of movement around whatever section of Rapture they were in, Bioshock Infinite instead holds the player's hand and leads them down one corridor to the next; the game's map design is basically a big, fat, straight line. Previously it would take some degree of exploration and attention to move onwards. Infinite, meanwhile, decides that it's done with all that non-linearity business, and makes sure there's an abundance of giant doors with comically oversized flashing locks on them so you know exactly which end of the hall goes to the next area. After you kill all the enemies there, get ready to fight more of them. Waves after waves of them, until the end of the game. 


Perhaps the worst part of all is that all of the main features that people were pumped for were instead revealed to be nothing like expected:

Those cool sky-rails that seemed to have so much potential? Almost exclusively used to circle around whatever area you happen to be mowing down baddies in.

Elizabeth having fun and dynamic interdimensional powers capable of smashing bad guys with items or having offensive and/or interesting combat use? They instead spawn in robots, skyhooks, cover, and guns/health/salts in a few predetermined places.

Those giant handymen that seemed like they'd be fun replacements for Big Daddies? Get ready to fight two of them in the entire game.

The giant bird that was anticipated so much and seemed like you'd have an amazing showdown with? You never fight it.

Expecting a pit-in-your-stomach feeling as you plummet towards the earth after walking off an edge? You simply teleport back to where you stepped off.

Having any choices in the game that could impact the ending or your overall power (like Big Daddies and harvesting/saving Little Sisters)? Don't expect anything even remotely similar, this game has no meaningful choices at all and has a hilariously stupid excuse for it (as well as the previously mentioned teleporting) that comes with the ending.

What else do you expect from a game that Levine admitted they had to rewrite 6 months before release to accomodate the ending he came up with? It's hard to go into detail about some things (like the lame explanation for tonics existing) without spoiling the hastily assembled story, but all you need to know is that despite the mildly charming and well crafted environment (one of the few good things in this game), Infinite is a very poor successor to the Bioshock series, and an incredibly mediocre game overall.",83045,1296,76561198000790100,2,22.47 hrs

356190,Middle-earth: Shadow of War,10/28/2017,False,"[b]UPDATE:
WB and Monolith have removed pay to win elements from this game, including lootboxes. I shall keep this review negative however, as a lesson to Publishers and Devs alike that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated.[/b]


[h1]Tl'dr version: [/h1]

[b]An amazing improvement upon the original, completely contaminated by some of the worst industry practices we have yet seen. Make no mistake, if the consumer base does not stop this now, we will be seeing not only microtransactions in $60 games but further degradation of the base game for them to wring every last ounce of money from us. DO NOT BUY THE LOOTBOXES.[/b]

You can follow me, and see the rest of my work here:
http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides

[h1]Elaborated version:[/h1]

Maybe from that you can already tell I will not just be talking about the base-game of Shadow of War for the whole review. Most reviewers policy is to separate industry practices from the game to judge the game ""on its own merits"". Well, here's my issues with that. If you are compromising the product on purpose, in order to drag the game out, or purposely tear the game apart in order for you sell us content later down the line, that is most definitely an already compromised (ethically and mechanically) product. 

If WB had kept their grubby mitts of this game, I would most definitely have given this a positive review. However, since that is not what they have done, this review will remain negative. 

[b]Microtransactions.[/b]

Some in-depth analysis here. Firstly, the infamous loot box situation. You can buy orks from loots boxes, not just getting them out in the in-game world. This completely breaks in-game immersion and the economy of the game. You can either choose to ignore the loot boxes and go at it vanilla, where you're missing out on possible high-level minions, as the game was obviously intended, as the level of orks you find are introduced on a gradient; the higher level you are, the better orks you will find. Additionally, what are essentially ads for the lootboxes keep popping up in game, where you are prompted to go and buy them. Also, if you want any hope of being 'competitive' in the online game mode Shadow Wars, you'll need some super powerful orks, something the lootboxes have the slight possibility to help with. 

Consequently, you will notice every dynamic in the game becomes centered around these things in some form of another:

You want an high level ork? Cough up! 
You want to upgrade your weapons and armor? You'll need additional gems to do that, cough up!
You want to play multiplayer? Better have some good orks, so cough up!!

Whether the game would have been constructed like this without the cancer that is WarnerBrothers getting their claws into the mechanics of the game is completely moot. 

Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the game.

[b]Story.[/b]

You a lord of the rings lore fan? This is going to be a rough ride. 
The game, for better or for worse, plays fast and lose with the canon to such an extent you wonder why not just set this in the time of the silmerilian and call it a day. However, if you can get past the desecration of established law (which I can), the story is actually quite compelling. 

Following on the last game, Ranger Talion and his ancient dead elf-friendo Calimbrimbor have made a new ring of power, just like Saurons. Great! What could go wrong. Turns out quite a lot actually. What follows is an epic, continent spanning war between the 'Bright Lord' and Sauron. All sorts of shenanigans ensue! Just don't get too disappointed if you were expecting high-brow Shakespeare. 


[b]Movement and Combat.[/b]

Like Shadows of Mordor but better. Everything is back from the last game, but with added upppf. Movement is buttery smooth, and really the game plays just like every other third-person openworld, Arkyum style game. Speaking of which, the combat system is straight outta Baan, which isn't a bad thing. 
Combat is fun and Talion's wraith powers are suitably beefed up from the last game. 

[b]The Nemesis system.[/b]
I was going to add this to the last section however, it more or less is one of the most original ideas in the last decade in gaming. Essentially, the Nemesis system allows every individual ork to remember you, and everything you've done to them. Burn that ork captain in a fire, he might come for you later on. This is extended to the 'meta game' aspect for creating armies. Your generals might betray you, or save your life. This creates some of the best dynamic stories in gaming really. However, sometimes the betrayals get a little too common, and you'll find yourself trying to game the system in order to keep your orks on your side. 
I won't say anything more, it really is something better to experience for yourself. 

[b]Sound.[/b]
Not the best, not the worst. Voice acting is passable, with a few exceptions. Talion seems mostly asleep during his cutscenes, the voice actor is clearly phoning it in for his paycheck at this point. On the other hand, Calimbrimbor is the star of the show. His gravely tones are both charismatic and slightly scary, especially when he gets all shouty. 
Combat noises are also quite good. Swords ring and the screams of orks will pervade your ears constantly. In this universe, all orks seem to have a slightly comical British cocny accent. You'll either love it or hate it. 


[b]Conclusion[/b]
Not concentrating on the poor industry behavior, this is a great game. However, I will not simply segregate them out of the review, because this stuff definitely effects the end product. Great game! But make a statement and wait for this to get to a low price. And DON'T, DON'T, DON'T buy those damn lootboxes!!",52022,2165,76561197998868500,132,22.38 hrs

I also want to give props to Wollay and Pixxie for their efforts to patch bugs and other problems with such short notice between the closed beta and public release, often fixing problems faster than any ""Triple A"" company.

Unfortunately it falls short of the mark, a lot of people will enjoy it and I have enjoyed what time I spent on it but I think this is as far as I will go as the entertainment begins to become frustration.

Things like region locking items and equipment and the lack of desire to explore as a result makes the game very bland. The fact that you go from overpowered in one zone to being infuriatingly under-powered in the next is pretty disappointing.

No EXP system (which then gives you very little reason to actually fight any of the enemies you find that you can actually take on) means that you never truly feel like you're getting anywhere. 

The item based progression (while it's a system that can work) hasn't been implemented as effectively as one would like to think and when combined with the region locking of equipment means that you never feel like you become stronger.

275850,No Man's Sky,8/14/2016,False,"First time reviewing a game; that‚Äôs how much I would warn you to not buy No Man‚Äôs Sky. Even if the game didn‚Äôt constantly crash, even if the FPS were good, even if the game did not require constant grinding to simply wash-rinse-and-repeat with no true progression, I would not recommend this game. If it were $20, maybe but not $60.

That being said, I will hand it to the creator; the mechanics behind No Man‚Äôs Sky are truly impressive and mind boggling but it ends there. 

---------------
A few more hours in: Crashing is fixed for me now and the FPS are stable with no more dips from 40-50FPS to 10FPS. 

The game pulled me back again and I have given it another try. Yet after each session I set down the controller and feel empty. I enjoy survival/exploration games. I do not mind monotonous tasks, in fact I quite enjoy the pace; it allows me the time think and a medium for rebuilding resiliency. I am always compelled to see what on the other side of the next hill, not because there something to be gained, rather just to do it.

However, No Man‚Äôs Sky still leaves me with very little sense of accomplishment. When I take a moment and look around me in our virtual universe I realize that where I am now is similar to where I have been and not too different from where I am going. Every day feels like Groundhog Day/Same-Same but different??????. This in its self is something that I would expect from a game of this size and complexity (or lack of complexity) but where my issue lies is that there is very little tying me to NMS. I do not really impact the universe and the universe honestly doesn‚Äôt impact me (maybe that‚Äôs the point?). 

We do NMS no justice by stratifying it against other games. With that being said, in other games that I enjoy there is this dynamic relation between me and virtual world which can manifest itself in many fashions. Even if I‚Äôm grinding for resources just to simply build something. At the end of the day I can look around and see my efforts regardless if I‚Äôm going to do the same thing tomorrow. In other instances, I may make not impact the virtual world at all, but I usually feel this sense building experiences when I can think back at my time in a game and ‚Äúremember that one time that I that thing because it was cool‚Äù even if it is insignificant to others. NMS gave me similar experiences for the first couple hours but after warping to dozens of stars I can say that I still feel empty. 

In my opinion it is not a bad game and has a good foundation for more. But for now its not worth my time and defiantly not worth the $60 I played.",64976,1833,76561198030792000,5,21.92 hrs

I awoke in ‚ÄúThe Hub‚Äù, a small and dilapidated city. 
My name? Jakku. Ex-Hive member. Worker class. 
Stricken with a sense of ambition long since forgotten amongst my brethren, I left the shackles of my home to create a mark in this world.
Step one? Get a weapon.
I knew I needed to fund my endeavours, so I began doing what I knew. I worked.
Mining for days on end. The sun rose and set many days as my steel-hardened hands chiselled away at the copper vein. 
The world was a blur. Many traders, escaped slaves, and bandits wandered past as I made my repeated trips to the nearest trade-hub.

Eat, mine, sell. Repeat.

I now had money to buy a better weapon. 
Step one? Success.

Slavers ‚Ä¶
They repeatedly harassed me, alongside nearby dust bandits. 
One group nearly caught me. They broke my arm. But days of trading and running ore back and forth has strengthened my legs. They could not keep up.

I needed protection.
Step two? Get a friend.

I narrowly escaped the ire of a nearby bandit leader with a substantial bounty on his head, only to stumble into an almost hostile Shek community.
They don‚Äôt like ‚Äúbugs‚Äù.

I found no help. Only insults. I rest in a bed to let my arm heal. I can‚Äôt wield my Naginata with only one arm.
Many moons pass. I dream of standing atop my own city. Strong, powerful, and satisfied.

I awake. I notice one awkward looking Shek in the corner. Her name is Ruka. She has been outcast, and wishes to join me.
I accept my new comrade and we venture onward.

Ruka, the former warrior treats me with somewhat disdain. Yet, she will learn the true strength of commient and hard work. 
She works the ore veins with me. She protects me.

Our closest call is a pack of wolves. Ruka valiantly falls as she protects me. I carry her to the nearby Ninja Trading hub. The guards rush out to protect their most loyal customer. 

We lay in bed. Healing, and dreaming of our futures.
We decide to gather our equipment and move onward.
We wonder the desert for a day, and encounter a large city. 
‚ÄòThe Holy Nation‚Äô. 
They don‚Äôt take kindly to outsiders. 
They attack us. 
I run. My legs, conditioned by years of backbreaking labour, assist me in outrunning the fools.

Ruka, too stalwart and stoic for most of her life ‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt fare so well. Her heavy legs drag her down and she is captured and imprisoned.

I escape to the nearest mountaintop, and I wait.

I am Jakku. Ex-Hive member. Worker class. Loyal companion.
I wait.
Ruka, while incarcerated, works daily on improving her clandestine skills. Lockpicking, stealth, and shadows become her ally.

From the mountaintop I watch. I never remove my gaze from her cell block.
Days pass. I am unwavering in my focus.
The slight flicker of a flame torch ....and finally, I see Ruka!
She glides through the shadows. She is as a different person. A creature. A wraith sweeping through the base unbeknownst to the Holy Nation fools.

I am proud to call her ‚Äòfriend‚Äô.
Ruka doesn‚Äôt see the small army of soldiers returning from their patrol. She is going to be caught.
I sweep down the mountainside and intercept the patrol. Distracted, they give chase. Now Ruka Now!
I easily slip the fools. And return to my perch and wait.

I hear footsteps behind me. 
It is a familiar face. Ruka.
We nod at each other in a sign of stoic respect. 

Together we move on. Far away from the Holy Nation fools. 
We head south. Toward the swamp.

Along our path we encounter a small tavern. Inside we refresh our supplies.
I encounter a former Hive Prince. 
He is eccentric, but I sense honesty in his eyes.

He introduces himself as ‚ÄòKoto‚Äô. 
We welcome him into the fold. A new comrade.
Upon approach to the swamp, I recall a warning I had overheard in the tavern; ‚ÄúBeware the swamp-spiders‚Äù. 
We take care to watch our footing.

A large town appears as if from nowhere, and we settle in for a short stay.
Something doesn‚Äôt seem right. The townsfolk are divergent.
They seem to be in a state of civil war.

We attempt to move onward until we are accosted by one of the faction‚Äôs leaders.
She threatens us.

My companions do not enjoy seeing me threatened.

They draw their weapons and eviscerate the fool.
We move onward.

Nightfall arises and we decide to set up camp.
The consensus is that we will move to an isolated location ‚Ä¶far away from this putrid swamp, and set up a defensive position.
My ambitions will be met. We will become strong together!

As we leave the swamp, Koto notices a small ‚Äòruin-like‚Äô structure nearby.
We deviate course to investigate.

Abandoned. However, a large building with a locked door promises hidden rewards. A perfect opportunity to fund our future bastion.

We lay waste to the door and stand witness to a library of books and treasure!

I take all my bag can carry. 
I attempt to fetch Koto to hand him some extra books, but he doesn‚Äôt respond ‚Ä¶

Swamp spiders! How could I have forgotten?!

Koto lay there. Dying. 
Ruka steps in to help, but is quickly overcome by four of the fiends.

I am all that is left standing.
Do I run? Do I fight?

I am Jakku. Ex-Hive member. Worker class. Loyal companion.

I swing my Naginata, and am quickly surrounded. The beasts are relentless. Soon, I am felled.
I lay there, faking my demise. 

The spiders, hideous beasts, quickly surround Koto. He is being eaten alive.
Ruka is dead.

I have an opportunity. I can run. My legs are un-injured. I can make it if I run without hesitation.

I weigh up my decisions.

I am Jakku. Ex-Hive member. Worker class. [u]Loyal companion [/u].

It IS repetitive and many missions seem the same as the last.  The only reason I love this game and can recommend it is because of how fantastically fun it is with a few friends.

For Example:

Just a few days ago my friend and I were chasing down a supply truck headed who knows where.  I call in a heli and he gets in.  While I fly next to the truck my friend attempts to shoot out the tires but the weak bullets seem to almost bounce off the sturdy structure of the truck.  Plan B.  Without saying anything I let up the throttle.  My friend is confused but I continue.  Full throttle.  The heli slowly tilts down as it gains speed and heads closer and closer to the ground and the truck.  I jump out and my friend follows just as the heli crashes into the truck in a massive, flaming explosion.  We hide behind the truck while fighting off hoards of bad guys.  Grenades, bullets, and various warcries in Spanish can be heard.  We eventually defeat our foes and tag the supplies, cheer together, mission over.

In 1999 SC3k was released, and it was also, great.  (Are you seeing a theme here?)

629760,MORDHAU,5/12/2019,True,"For existing players:

Yes, it is rage inducing. Yes, that sword did hit you. ""How?"" very easily, you didn't block it. Player with maul wondering how they lost to a player with a training sword? All weapons are different. Each with their own speeds. Yes, some weapons hit harder than others. Some are longer than others and yes that guy on your team blind firing the catapult DOES deserve to die, no one will blame you if that player was to disappear. 

You must accept that 80% of the time, you are the one who messed up. There is that 20% due to internet connectivity and sometimes lack of hit registration (Seen players complain but never happened to me). 

If you ever struggle when playing, try out third person. You might find yourself surviving 3 vs 1 encounters. Also, try to create custom classes and look at the weapon stats. Also, there is an offline mode you can use to practise against AI.

For potential buyers:

If you anger easily or prone to rage quit, then this game isn't for you.

It is rage inducing and you will question half the hits you take/inflict. But in a 32 vs 32 match it is very chaotic. Allies and enemies charging into one another and then immediately stopping because they really want to protect their Kill Death ratio. That lute player somehow playing Metallica... There is a lot to take in. A load of unique classes as well as a class creation system. You want to have 3 lutes on your person at all time? Go for it. 

Gameplay: 

The weapon combat is great using your mouse and avatar to make swings hit faster or slower. The various strengths of each weapons. For example, spears are better at stabbing than for swinging. Weapons will collide with surfaces which will stop their momentum. Parry‚Äôs and feints are available allowing you to psyche out your opponent. Armour affects your movement and overall damage you can take. Armour is located on three areas: Head, Torso and Legs. There is chambering which I do not fully understand and most of the time I‚Äôm to mystified by it to realise I should strike back.
You can create your own class which is a ton of fun. The system works by having a limited amount of points and every item costing points dependant on strength of item. There is medical equipment you can carry that helps survivability of you or your team. There‚Äôs an engineer class that lets you build fortification (Only in specific areas) and ballistae. Engineer tools are available for create your own class. You also have access to perks when creating classes. Bows I do not personally use. Prefer to swing a sword in a hazardous environment than shoot from a safe distance.  There‚Äôs probably a lot of information I‚Äôve missed, feel free to fact check me.
Extra (Just things):


There are 3 stages you will go through when fighting larger skirmishes with your allies in MORDHAU.

Stage 1: ""I'll just use stabs and therefore, won't hurt my allies!""

Stage 2: ""Whoops sorry! Didn't mean to hit you there!""

Stage 3: ""Why are you standing within axe-swinging distance?!?! Do you have a death wish?!?""

If you see a lute player on the opposite team. Let them pass, they‚Äôre likely late for their gathering and deserve the right of way.

Now the player base is divided personality wise. You have the tryhards which every game must be a win otherwise the game is shit. The casual players who will emote and are more likely to be friendly. You will have the new players who can often be found wondering to parts unknown and endangering the wild life (Other players with their dam catapults). You also get the team killing for horses or siege equipment. I like horse as much as anyone, but I‚Äôll dismount for class with a longer weapon than mine and of course if they‚Ä¶ ASK! Yea, no one ask for anything and just expects you to know better? Players complain when they‚Äôre killed by anything. I had a guy complain after I killed him with his own throwing axe. Not all players are like this, but you only notice the annoying ones who team kill, disrupt funny moments, etc‚Ä¶

Appreciate you reading this.

(This about the new update, I appreciate the comments and I'm pleased that people found this review helpful)

Update Edit: Update added Crossroads a map everyone apparently hates? Yet votes it in every time? I enjoy Crossroads aesthetically and it has helped me get better at horse combat. Red is the dominant team on the map as they can go to an elevated position and chuck or shoot stuff at your spawn. The map gives me mood swings like no other. At one point I‚Äôm 25 - 8 next game I‚Äôm 3 ‚Äì 23 (Kill/death ratio). It is very open and has become the map to play archer on. I personally think the map should be a deathmatch one though.

Taiga update added one entrance way into the middle objective. Now Blue has more of a chance of winning. I kind of miss the fights along the log bridge though.
Heavy Hand-axe is fun to use high damage and its alt-fire allows you to fortify defences. It is funny watching engineers panic as they see 3 Heavy Hand-axe users smack the crap out of their spikes. They get very defensive‚Ä¶
Love the javelin, hate it when I‚Äôm pelted by about 3 of them. I look like a hedgehog by the end of a skirmish. You get 2 javelins when you equip it in one of your slots.

The community‚Ä¶ Most are ok‚Ä¶ But holy crap do players get mad. Either I didn‚Äôt notice it before or Crossroads has unleashed MORDHAU players inner demons. I‚Äôm no angel, I get mad too. Holy crap though, Toxic as all hell some days. However, there are a few funny players that make it worthwhile. On Grad me and an opponent took turns firing the ballista, it was surprisingly civil. I would fire, step away then he would fire and ect.

Also, lute players are still alive and well. I‚Äôm disappointed in the backstabbing ones though‚Ä¶

1128000,Cube World,9/30/2019,False,"TL;DR at bottom, but hear me out - whether you like the game or not, I think this is worth reading. Initially, I was not going to write a negative review for this game because it might just not be my kind of game. I have seen -some- people claiming that they enjoy it. I only enjoyed the first few hours, personally, but that's not what this review is about. Reminder that this is just my opinion, and everyone is entitled to one. I will try to stay factual in my review and I will link sources from some information I reference at the bottom.
 
[b] I do not want to let wollay's unconventional, ineffective, and borderline disrespectful development practices become obscured by our current complaints and concerns. [/b] The following list is, in my opinion, the core examples of these development practices. I'll try my best to keep it under 20 pages. Reminder again that this is my list and my opinion, feel free to add to it in comments or voice your thoughts if they are different, the same, anything. I do want this game to succeed, just saying. All criticism is meant constructively, and I in no way have any ill will towards picroma or wollay or anyone.

[list]
[*]Teased content seemingly scrapped before release. This sets everyone up with an expectation of what the game will be like, and when you build an expectation like this for literal years, it is even more shocking and confusing when that expectation is fairly different from the end product. It is doubly confusing when that content was supported by the community, while the new(er) changes, that have only just now seen the light of day, would not have been.
 
[*]Map generation. We are all on the same world map (hosted locally, unless you're playing multiplayer) but spawned in random locations. This does not seem too problematic at first. The old website DID tout ""Infinite Worlds"" as a core feature (it's the top feature listed), with on-the-fly world generation, custom seed specification for individual world generation, and so on, but that's not too big of a problem. The issue is, what happens when new content is added? Will the current map be force updated for everyone? In alpha, characters and maps were separate, but now they are linked; will my character become obsolete if a big update involving new biomes, changes to structures, etc. is released? I do not have too much information to base those questions on, mind you, so please correct me if you know what will happen.

[*]No one other than wollay and pixxie have played this game since alpha released. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find anyone claiming otherwise. It is inconceivable to me that someone would try to develop a game with this much hype and potential without any outside opinion, if it is true that no one else has played it. I personally bought the alpha the day it came out, and to my knowledge I, nor my friends who also bought it then, have never been contacted regarding my opinion, a signup for testing, etc.
 
[*]No public response regarding initial complaints and concerns with the game in the last week it's been available. We have gone a full week with major concerns raised earning no response. I understand the viewpoint of having a hard time to deal with criticism from the community, facing backlash and threats or retaliation in the past, etc., but a simple ""I hear your complaints and concerns"" of some sort is truly the least wollay could do, and he has not. Also, no price announcement until release is kind of weird.
 
[/list]
I truly do not want to come off as though I feel totally entitled to special treaent for buying alpha, or for spending money on the game, or for supporting it. I personally have not followed cube world much at all since alpha. I do not think spending money on a product in alpha entitles anyone to special treaent, the game that THEY want, or anything in between. I just cannot fathom developing a game with a community that supported a hiatus this long, and making the decisions wollay makes.
 
I do not think it is something we should encourage, or positively reinforce with buying the game. I am not comfortable with showing other developers that this is an ok way to handle community interaction and the development process, just as I am not comfortable buying unfinished EA games riddled with paywalls, DLC, and lootboxes, showing other developers that this type of ""content"" is ok.

[b]TL;DR
 
Whether you are enjoying Cube World or not, this should be a valuable lesson in how not to develop a successful game. Community involvement is important. Multiple outside opinions during development is important. Showcasing the planned final version of the game way sooner than just seven days before release, is important. Building expectations to completely change them at the last minute, since we have not been able to play until now, is going to be perceived as negative change. Most importantly, avoiding delivering a public response to criticism from closed beta testers who have supported your project for the past six years is, simply put, not the way to go. Wollay has truly shown that he does not value the community that has supported him thus far now that we have concerns about the game's health and direction. I believe we as video game players should not positively reinforce this behavior by buying the game.[/b]

Please do not hesitate to let me know what you think of the game, my review, anything really. Sorry if anything I said was inaccurate, I tried to do my research on any claims I made. For the record, I have 21 hours logged on the closed beta, mostly due to peer pressure trying to get me to finish my kingdom's artifacts and see if ++ gear exists, but now that it is confirmed to not exist I will not be playing further until significant change is made. Playing past my starting zone was not fun, and I will not be doing it again. A screenshot of my character and the best + gear I found will be linked below

For those who have said that Dying Light's day/night mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesn't actually change in the game clearly haven't played past the intro missions. The first two missions are obviously there to get you started, so they're not going to thrust a timed day/night cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanics, and thus in the intro missions, time does not change if you don't progress the quest. Past those two missions, day/night becomes very real, and incredibly terrifying. /endRant


Gameplay:
I'm sure it's been said before, but this is what Dead Island should have been. Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid. Running around is great fun, and jumping into abandoned houses and exploring/finding loot is constantly fun. And this is where I got caught in my first night phase. I was running towards my objective when ""oh look another shelter, let me go secure it,"" then ""oh look there's an air drop nearby, let me go grab it,"" then again another shelter nearby, on top of random houses and zombies (sorry, ""biters"") to loot, and before I knew it, I got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick (mind you, the Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get home, but I just have to keep scrounging for loot). I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelter, so I just booked it. This is where freerunning gets exciting. With how seemless and smooth it is to run around/through buildings and across rooftops, the run to my shelter didn't feel annoying or like a chore, but more like a challenge to find the smoothest route (very similar to Mirror's Edge). Long story short, night fell, I shat my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftop, listening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter. I've since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a quest, and I can tell you, as of right now, I am definitely not prepared... but I'm damn excited to finally face the challenge.

+ Fluid, seemless parkour
+ Combat is fun
+ Enemy AI is surprisingly smart
+ Terrifying and exciting night cycle
+ Scavanging every nook and cranny for loot

Characters:
Some characters are well-performed while others just aren't. Gazi's performance, in my opinion, is laughably bad, but I began to think that it may have been intentional? And Rahim... he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the day, all he needs to do is dye his hair yellow. Brecken, Jade and Lena are among my favorite so far, with Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DA:Inquisition with her hair and accent. Overall, characters are decent, and that's all that really needs to be said, so far at least.

+ Some interesting characters
- Some poor performances

Technical:
Graphics are gorgeous, and surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080. Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance option, I can barely see much of a difference in-game with that option set to half or max. The only issue I've noticed is that very very rarely, when you're fighting biters with melee weapons, the game randomly hitches, then continues normally. It only happens in combat, but not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system. Overall, everything looks great, and the graphics and effects are wonderful. For an ugly game, the visuals are surprisingly beautiful.

Sound:
Music is great, but my only comment is that the music that plays when you're outside has one part where a random singer begins to chant, and I swear it scares the crap out of me every time. Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfying, and you can tell when you've hit the right spot, while hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump. I've yet to get a gun though (I've spent a lot of time just wandering around so I'm not too far into the campaign) so I can't comment on that. Also, make a little bit more noise and you'll hear bone-chilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you. Very satisfying sound work overall.

Story:
I haven't gotten far into the story so I'll hold off until I've completed it to fill this section.

I basically wanted to come out and say how much I'm enjoying this game and to tell people to ignore the false statements about this game and give it a try. If you liked Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you hated Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you're a fan of first person, open-world games, then I'd bet you'll like this game.",65433,1829,76561197961017400,21,20.98 hrs
648350,Jurassic World Evolution,6/12/2018,False,"See this is a tough one. I'm really torn because the time I have spent in the game I have absolutely loved. The dinosaurs look amazing and being able to give them different colour palettes helps a lot in making the dinosaurs unique. However, that's pretty much where it ends. The dinosaurs don't really interact with each other in meaningful ways (like herding and pack hunting in JPOG), the buildings and attractions look bland and uninspired, the guests feel so soulless and boring, and the park altogether feels really dead. I think the issue here is the price. It is a perfectly good game, for maybe half the price it is now. At the current price it's just not worth it. I'm going to spend a lot of time in this game and I love it, but I think that's only because I really love the Jurassic Park franchise and dinosaurs as well. Looking at it without rose tinted glasses, well, it falls a bit short.

However, I do want to say this. I don't often post reviews, barely any actually, unless I think I have something important to say. I certainly do in this case. This game desperately needs the developers to continue to support this game and improving it like they do with their other games. I understand that they needed the game out now to match up with the Fallen Kingdom release. Another year of development and all these problems would probably be ironed out. I'm going to stick with this game and look forward to every improvement that Frontier brings. But, for everyone else, you're probably better off waiting for a sale or until the game gets some much needed depth.

Some much needed improvements:
Better AI (top priority)
Better guests (why not give different guests different needs? Carno lovers, families who love herbivores, etc.)
More structures (varied amenities, rides)
More animations for the dinosaurs (more kill animations, social animations)

Just more depth really. Right now it's like the best pool ever but it's so shallow I can only walk through it. It's so close to being something great that it pains me to not recommend it. But I optimistically wait for the future in hopes that Frontier will turn this into the best dinosaur game ever, and the sequel that Operation Genesis deserves.

It's even more outlandish to imagine a remake, let alone one by a group of self-taught modders, that surpasses the original Half-Life, an FPS that is only rivaled by the 1993 Doom in its excellence and legacy.

This is exactly what the Crowbar Collective have accomplished.

Black Mesa is a vivid reimagining of Half-Life, adding everything learned and invented in the Source Engine and Half-Life 2, while maintaining the original game's distinct tone and aosphere. Enemies have smarter and more varied AI, allies are more lifelike and engage in more dialog, the world is far more detailed and teases more at the greater world outside of the game, puzzles take advantage of the Havok physics engine (but don't feel tacked-on), and weapons look and sound and feel as powerful as ever.

Perhaps the coup-de-grace for Black Mesa is the final chapters in the Border World, Xen. The general consensus among the gaming public is that Xen is Half-Life's weakest point, a climax marred by annoying jumping puzzles and inconsequential boss fights. While the Xen is Half-Life's dimmest part, Xen in Black Mesa is its most shining hour.

Xen in Black Mesa is much longer than in Half-Life, accounting for about a quarter of the game now. The alien world that shows signs of taking over before reaching the Lambda Complex is now made fully manifest before you, a stunning space between spaces where humanity does not belong, and has only begun to pay the price for forcing its way in. Xen features plenty of new gameplay and puzzle mechanics (never overused), new monsters, and a fascinatingly fleshed out look at the place the Vortigaunts and friends call home.

All of this is set to a fantastic soundtrack by Joel Nielsen. It's not the electronica by Kelly Bailey, but Neilsen's music drives home the terror, the urgency, and the wonder both inside and outside Black Mesa all the same. Neilsen deserves to become the next Andrew Hulshult, and that's a fact.

Half-Life: Alyx, being a VR title, is going to be out of reach for a lot of people. Black Mesa, on the other hand, runs pretty damn nice on any halfway-decent gaming PC. If you want some Half-Life and you don't have a VR kit, absolutely grab Black Mesa. If you have a VR kit and you're going for Half-Life: Alyx, you probably have the money to pick this one up too, and you absolutely should.",60691,1512,76561197993205100,12,20.47 hrs
289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,11/21/2018,False,"This review is in response to the forced update of November 2018 for this game, the previous game in the series, Civilisation 5 and the issues they cause.

For those unaware, this update made changes to the pre-game launcher, which allowed you to select which version of the game you would like to run (DX9, DX11 etc.) and only this. With the new launcher they have included ads (which from appearances are obtained from a server, more on this later) for the next game in the series, Civilisation 6. 

There are multiple issues which stem from this change, starting with the subjective change of including ads to a 10 year old game which is unlikely to receive any beneficial updates in the future, as well as damaging compatibility with certain mods. The objective Issues are: 

- That (as of the time of this review) the launcher is still watermarked as a beta.
- The quality of the game's graphics have been reduced.
- Users have reported that the launcher either launches the game using the wrong version of DirectX
- Users have reported that with the new update they [b] can't launch the game at all. [/b]
- Users have reported that either the launcher itself is [b] infected with malware [/b] or (more likely imo) any data the launcher may be receiving from a server (e.g: images and hyperlinks for ads) can and has been compromised, thus [b] creating vulnerabilities in users' devices. [/b]

While the subjective changes are up to the user to judge, I'll make my opinion clear - performing updates that compromise the core functions of the game, as well as compromising my security and privacy [b] is unacceptable. Under any circumstances. [/b] 2K are doubly damned for making these changes to an 8 year old game with the only intent being to include ads for a game [i] regardless of whether the user already owns it. [/i]

This review will not be changed (even if the update is reverted) purely on principle as this update was not necessary, ethically sound or a good invesent of money and manpower. 

[b] TL;DR: 2K made a pointless update to the more popular 8 year old predecessor, resulting in user security being compromised. Read the review. [/b]

213670,South Park: The Stick of Truth,11/8/2014,True,"Fantastic game.  The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot.

But the game isn't without its flaws.  I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome.

The game feels heavily ""consolized.""  Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense.  Throughout the game your character will be taught ""magic spells"" from various NPCs.  Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell.  However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another‚Äîand in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!

Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use.

Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC.  I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller.  Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game.  But not in combat.  In combat the controls felt great.  More on that later, though.

On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts.  This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning‚Äîit IS South Park, after all!  The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back.  I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic.

There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere.  The loading screens are a real slowdown.

So let's see.  The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention.  So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!

While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right.  As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight.  This isn't your typical ""select an ability and watch what happens"" kind of turn-based combat.  Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls.

For example, Butters the Paladin has a ""Hammer of Justice"" ability.  To use it, you select it and then choose a target.  The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button.  Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy!  If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much.  Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same.

Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this.  When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time.  Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks!  Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard.

These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair.  The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls.  Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability.

While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes.  Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by.  Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them.  Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results.

It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them.  But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!

There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress.  As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare‚Äîpick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in.  The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well.

The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can.  It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest.

The writing in the game is spot on.  You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character.  I found the story largely fun and interesting.

I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game.  This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy.

Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style.  You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks.  As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume (""gear""), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories.  You'll even find ""strap-ons"" (for weapons) and ""patches"" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle.

I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show.  There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park.  It's a funny game.

There is also a difficulty slider bar.  Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding.  The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight.  I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately.  Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions.

Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan.  I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews.  :)",20761,1251,76561197973299300,3,20.08 hrs

8870,BioShock Infinite,11/30/2013,True,"Like the first game, Bioshock Infinite is a very thematically ambitious game. One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming. There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one. There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles. And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back. Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals. It's got a lot to say. The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does. While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same. You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout. These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand. They add to the story, the world and the aosphere. To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game. For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.

The world of Columbia is wider and more open than the claustrophobic and enclosed Rapture, gun fights involve more enemies than the original Bioshock. The problem with this is that it devalues the fights itself. In the original Bioshock, enemies were something to fear. Even the most basic ones could do damage to you if you're not prepared. In Infinite, most enemies are just faceless guards who you just simply have to shoot in order to progress to other parts of the story. Most fights just end up repetitive, and though the game allows you to use various methods such as vigors and skyhooks to defeat enemies, rarely do you ever need to. Most of the game you're grossly overpowered, even if you're not upgrading your vigors or weapons.

Another thing, though admittedly it's a nitpick, the dissonance between the beautiful story and the violent shooting is something worth mentioning. Sometimes the dialogue and the ""breather"" scenes seem to be slightly disrupted by the high amounts of adrenaline shooting that follows. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's certainly something that could be done better. Less emphasis on gunplay and maybe some more exploration elements could benefit this game.

Bioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one. A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007. It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well. If you enjoyed exploring the world of Rapture in 2007, then you'll love going through the land of Columbia, here.",66460,1017,76561198048871900,103,19.90 hrs
814380,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,3/24/2019,False,"[h1]DISCLAIMER[/h1]
Personally, I do enjoy Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. However, unlike with From Software‚Äôs previous titles, I would not recommend this to the average gamer looking for a tough-but-fair experience, which is why I opted to give it a ‚Äúwould not recommend‚Äù label instead. I wish there was a ‚Äúmixed‚Äù option, or a way to simply write a review without being forced to labelling a game as positive or negative, but there isn‚Äôt.

[b]That said, I would thoroughly recommend Sekiro to you if you enjoy sitting down and intently studying move sets of enemies and bosses, not minding repeated re-tries until you eventually figure out how to react to each of their attacks on an order of magnitude way above the Souls series; and if you liked the parry system in the Dark Souls series, because, at its core, Sekiro is largely a parry game.[/b]

These are my thoughts on the game [strike]so far, roughly 20 hours in. It is possible that some of the observations and assumptions in the following write-up will change, however, it is unlikely.[/strike] I have meanwhile beaten the game (~30 hours) and my opinions remain largely unchanged! If anything, my issues with the game got exacerbated by the design of the last few areas and bosses. 


[h1]Combat & Combat-related[/h1]
Combat feels overly punishing at times, and requires persistent mastery over the game magnitudes higher than any previous From Software games did.

Minibosses, bosses and even most regular enemies push out intense damage, commonly being able to kill Wolf with 2-3 attacks. Most* bosses and minibosses can only feasibly be killed by building up their posture gauge, which is mostly done by deflecting their attacks; requiring near perfect moveset knowledge from the player before they have any real chance of defeating them.

Bosses tend to have checkpoints close to their boss arenas, however, minibosses do not. Additionally, miniboss arenas tend to have other enemies placed in them. Whenever you die to a miniboss, you are forced to clear out the entire arena of regular enemies before you can engage the miniboss again. In arenas with 7-10 other creatures on patrol paths that require you to sneak around and wait for them to patrol past you, this gets tedious quick.
 
Certain types of enemies can only be properly damaged by using certain items. Those items do not replenish upon resting at a shrine, and so, if you die a lot to bosses that require the use of said items, you will be forced to regularly leave the area and either farm up sen to buy more supplies, or to farm enemies and hope for the right items to drop.

[i]*Certain enemies and bosses take little posture damage, forcing a type of fight more similar to From Software‚Äôs previous titles. However, the vast majority of boss fights are designed for deflection style of combat.[/i]
 
[h1]Death[/h1]
Death seems to be the most punishing out of all of From Software‚Äôs previous titles.

You lose 50% of your carried sen and 50% of your progress towards your next skill point whenever you die. This is mostly par for the course considering their previous games.

However, dying has consequences to the NPCs around you. More and more NPCs will eventually become sick as you die more often, halting their questline progressions until you cure them. Curing an NPC can be done, however, the cure is only temporary (if you continue dying, NPCs will get sick again), and the items required to create the cure are extremely limited (the wiki currently lists their total number at 8, but as the game is new still, there might be undiscovered merchants). If you mismanage your cure timings, cure too liberally, or simply die too much, you will lock yourself out of NPC questlines.

[h1]Exploration[/h1]
Moving through the world feels great, with many hidden nooks and crannies, side paths and optional areas.

The grappling hook adds fantastic verticality to nearly every place you visit, often allowing you to avoid a frontal approach and instead come in from behind or above and take out a bunch of enemies. The level design is top-notch.

However, the joy of exploration is greatly stifled by the absence of real new weapons and armour pieces. 95% of all the loot you will ever find are coin pouches and consumables, the other 5% are new prosthetic tools and the rare item that upgrades your stats. Finding yet another ceramic shard that you can throw at enemies doesn‚Äôt feel exciting. Finding the latter feels rewarding, since those types of items tend to be guarded by tough opponents. The worst part is that, sometimes, tough enemies and even mini-bosses guard dead-ends with no interesting loot whatsoever. All in all, not being able to find new weapons or armour pieces puts a big damper on the joy of exploration.

[h1]Skill System[/h1]
The game features a skill tree to upgrade Wolf with. With only two types of skill upgrades available, passives and special moves (of which you can only have 1 active), the skill system feels rather bare-bones.

The prosthetic upgrading system has a lot of options, adding roughly 3 variations to each of Wolf‚Äôs prosthetic tools (of which you can only have 1 slotted per tool). 

It is unlikely that you will be able to fully unlock all skills nor all prosthetics unless you intend to do a heavy amount of grinding, and some materials needed to upgrade the prosthetic might be limited per playthrough.

There is no real way to change up your playstyle. None of the passive or active skills or prosthetic upgrades alter the core playstyle in any meaningful way. Unlike their Demons‚Äôs/Dark Souls series, you won‚Äôt be able to customise your character to fit a certain playstyle.

[h1]Bugs & Glitches[/h1]
I‚Äôve run into these only rarely, but they do exist and most of them lead to the death of Wolf, resulting in you losing half of your sen and skill experience to no fault of your own.

The jumping system is a bit of a mess and finicky to control. At times, Wolf will slide off of platforms, that, moments earlier you were able to jump on perfectly fine. 

When fighting enemies with big weapons on slopes, Wolf has been literally hammered ‚Äúinto the ground‚Äù, rendering him uncontrollable, stuck inside the level geometry and forcing a death or ALT+F4.

Occasionally, the grappling system (especially the grapple-from-point-to-point version) flings you into directions that get you killed: like literally away from the next grapple point.

Trying to jump onto certain objects can leave Wolf in an endless falling animation loop, with the only means of escape being ALT+F4, which could potentially lead to your save file becoming corrupted (the chance of actual save corruption should be highly unlikely, however).

Like I wrote above, overall I do enjoy Sekiro but many of the design decisions have moved the game into a spot where I don‚Äôt feel I can rightly recommend the title to the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù gamer, unlike their Souls series. This is mainly due to the intense damage you take from nearly everything in the game, and the requirement to sit down and absolutely learn attack patterns. In Dark Souls you had a good chance of beating a boss, even if it was your first encounter with it. With Sekiro, for every boss and miniboss I have fought, I needed a couple attempts to study and learn how to react to their move sets. At times I walked away and came back later, due to how tedious it is to repeatedly and slowly clear out miniboss arenas. This requirement to borderline perfectly learn a move set for every miniboss and boss you encounter and the requirement of mastery over so many enemies, I feel, is something that might turn average, less dedicated, gamers away from the title.",92616,1577,76561197977887400,23,19.87 hrs
640820,Pathfinder: Kingmaker,9/26/2018,True,"[h1] In A Nutshell [/h1]

?? [b] Pros [/b]
+ Exceptional variety of classes available, boosting replay-ability by a lot.
+ Very deep and complex combat mechanics.
+ The Pathfinder setting is one of the best Fantasy ones around.
+ Excellent voice acting in dialogues and narration.
+ Very well written and varied story, role-playing interactions.
+ Quality graphics for a CRPG.
+ Great variety of enemies, loot, weapons, equip, and spells.

?? [b] Cons [/b]
- Time limit on Main Quest and also on certain critical Events later on. Very annoying.
- Fatigue / Resting mechanics, as of now, are annoying and make exploration less enjoyable.
- Way too many random fights while traveling.
- Problems with enemy balance in several fights, making them too much RNG dependent or frustrating.
- Cannot create a custom party from the start, mainly for money reasons. This can lead to unbalanced composition.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker (PK from now) is a classic RPG set in the universe of Pathfinder, one of the most famous and iconic ones of all time. The game starts out impressively well, boasting a huge amount of character classes to choose from, and suit all the play styles and roleplaying needs, each with its own skill trees and sub-classes even, assuring an incredible variety. The character building system is the classic, deep, old-school CRPG one using attributes and lots of statistics, and based on d20 rule-set, with a few modifications here and there.

The impossibility to create a custom party from the start, typical of many old-school RPGs such as Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale to mention a few, is a bit disappointing, and also can lead to party composition problems later on, as depending on choices, different ""mandatory"" companions, with preset classes, will be added to your party, which can in turn become unbalanced in a negative manner. A custom party is doable, but only later.

PK adds to the classic CRPG formula some management gameplay: first you will have to take care of the fatigue needs of your party, manage money well to afford camping supplies, potions and healers, and be efficient in your travel paths, while later, you will eventually be able to manage your very own little kingdom, with most of the aspects deriving from such responsibility. In part all this is new and welcome, but on the other hand, such mechanics are several times made in ways that make them more annoying than anything else.

[b]Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a deep and wide CRPG title, with some excellent points to it as you can read above, but also several issues regarding game design and balancing, which weigh pretty heavily on the overall experience, resulting ultimately in a far less enjoyable gameplay than it should.[/b]

[h1] In-depth Feature Analysis [/h1]

 
?? [b] Gameplay [/b]
The gameplay of PK is based mainly on Exploration, Combat, Role-playing and Management.

Exploration is performed via a global map featuring pre-determined roads to follow, and many crossroads to decide directions. Even if the path is not free but ""on rails"", the game still features a good amount of locations and places to discover around the world. There is no fast travel, traveling takes a long time and your party can encounter enemies and random events while doing so, and also need rest pretty often. Fatigue builds up the more you travel, depending on constitution of each character, but sooner or later rest is needed or major penalties to attributes occur, making combat and checks a lot harder.

Role-playing interactions, as in any CRPG, should be the crown jewel of the experience, and in fact they are in PK, which features very well-written dialogues, a vast array of options, some of which unique and tied to the player's specific class, alignment, or other factors, and deeply branching dialogue trees. On this side, this title is excellent and will be the joy of any role-player.

Management part is about rationing resources wisely, using resting supplies sparingly, being efficient in traveling around, and later, managing resources and other aspects of your very own kingdom, including repelling invasions and hiring advisors. The fact invasions are also timed and your presence is needed to repel them in a certain time, will be rather annoying, as if you are in the middle of something, you'll have to go back.

?? [b] Story [/b]
The storyline featured in PK is long and complex, as relations between noble houses and kingdoms come into play often, as do intrigues and struggles for power. Not only, but your alignment and relationship with companions can even change the outcome of many events, making the possibilities all the more interesting! Writing is great albeit some typos here and there, and companions / characters are interesting and have great personalities.

?? [b] Combat System [/b]
Combat is real-time with dynamic pause, a classic for CRPGs. Since it uses a d20 rule-set as core, expect an uncompromising, deep and complex battle system worthy of the classics of old, where a lot of factors need to be considered, and where each fight is a tactical challenge on its own. The only problem with it is balance, as you will soon see.


?? [b] Content & Pricing [/b]
As expected from any CRPG, the game is very long on its own, depending on how much you explore and quests you take, and difficulty aswell, the game can last even 80+ hours. For the proposed price of 40‚Ç¨, i'd say the game is worth buying for the amount of content offered alone.


?? [b] Balance & Challenge [/b]
There are serious issues here. Several encounters on the Challenging and above difficulties are incredibly punishing and unfair, making the player rely more on lucky strikes of RNG rather than strategy. This would be okay if happened seldom, but instead happens quite often. The mechanics about Fatigue, Camping and Resting are unnecessarily annoying and result in the exploration becoming a chore instead of interesting as it should be. These are by FAR the worst issues of the whole game.



[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]


?? [b] Graphics [/b]
Very good for this genre, using Unity3D engine and achieving surprising results. effects, textures and models are of good quality, while portraits and art are superb. Excellent.

?? [b] Sound [/b]
Good soundtracks, excellent voice-acting, and average effects. Solid.

?? [b] Performance & Stability [/b]
Performance needs some optimization work at the moment, but with some setting tweaking most issues can be solved. Decent. [GTX1080, i7 4820K, 16GB RAM]

?? [b] Artificial Intelligence [/b]
Enemy AI is pretty smart and will focus one character to quickly kill them sometimes, and use advanced tactics such as flanking and pincer maneuvers. Companion AI is not that smart sadly, and sometimes your peers will just do nothing, and have to be manually commanded most of the time.

?? [b] Quality of Life [/b]
No issues to report.

?? [b] Bugs & Issues [/b]
There are quite a few minor bugs around, but nothing major to report. Many people did report save-game corruption and crashes, but this never happened to me.



[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Kingmaker is a very good CRPG in many aspects, but those few downsides are quite critical because of how they impact the overall experience, and really hold it back from being a truly great title.

356190,Middle-earth: Shadow of War,10/11/2017,False,"Pros:
- Better movement across the large maps
- Similar gameplay to its predecessor -- doesn't completely change the formula
- Grindy, if you're like me, you may enjoy spending more time killing captains and leveling up than actually playing main quests
- Massive landscapes with lots of impressive views
- Fleshed out army building: More interaction on recruiting and leveling up dominated enemies.
- Some really fun main quest battles that slightly deviate from the repetitive side quests
- Tons of lore that is delivered via main menu, in-game, and cinematic videos.
- Despite reports, I was getting relatively smooth gameplay ~40-60FPS from my Titan X Maxwell (NOT the newer Titan X Pascal) running 4K: 3840x2160 on ultra. There was some choppiness when it came to assassin/ambush captain pop ins, otherwise been smooth. Also, no crashes in my ~20 hours of play.

Neutral:
- Microtransactions -- there's a lot of strife over this, so instead of writing about it ad-nausem, I'll say this: Aside from the trolly T.O.S. screen (desribed below), didn't affect my gameplay (I didn't purchase anything nor was I nagged in-game to purchase anything from it).

Cons:
- The annoying T.O.S. -- I accepted the Terms of Service, but didn't accept the collecting of data (checkbox). Now, everytime I start OR exit the game, the T.O.S. screen pops back up wanting me to accept the data collection. Instead, I have to accept and leave the checkmark box empty over and over and over and over and over. Never in my gaming history have I had a T.O.S. screen be that trolly. 
- Lack of customization -- the swords/shiv/cloaks/rings etc. are just stat upgrades. You can't customize the character's look nor can you differentiate between a level 1 sword from a level 25 sword.  
- Predictable - captain assassin/ambush/betrayl pop-ins will mainly appear after sending death threats. Doesn't feel like RNG, but rather staged gameplay to distract the player.
- Climbing walls -- when it comes to arch-ways, the climbing becomes super wonky, particularly if you're climbing on the front-face and are attempting to drop inside of/underneath it. Also, some of the wired ""walkways"" won't allow the player to move forward. He'll go into the crouched position and stick at the beginning of the wire.
- The AI -- you can sneak in front a generic enemy's face and assassinate them. Or worse, they could be looking right at you and say, ""Where did he go!?"". Some minor tweaks should fix this issue.
- Repetitive -- the gameplay, so far, has become repetitive. Very similar to Shadow of Mordor, but with a touch of Just Cause 3 style of play, where areas need to be ""liberated"" (captured), before the story continues. Unfortunately, this becomes quite repetitive after about 15 hours.
- The game size -- 100GB ladies and gentlemen. That includes the game, the 4k DLC cinemas and the DLC high-res texture packs. If you have a slower than 1 gigabit connection or have a data cap or have limited harddrive space... I'm sorry! https://imgur.com/m9gjJm0

Glitches as of v1.01:
- Captain loot -- Early on, I ended up getting a bow that I already had equipped at the time. However, since it's a level 1, I couldn't dismantle it. So I'm stuck with two level 1 bows with the same stats that I can't dismantle.
- Broken Shelob memories - after solving ANY of the spider web puzzles, I get about 1-2 seconds of video before it rewinds, makes a loud pop and goes back to the gameplay: https://youtu.be/GbYwCjGYSUw 
***This may only affect those who have the 4K DLC installed.***
- Enemies respawn too quickly - After defeating a main quest/side quest/kill a captain, enemies will respawn in place within seconds. This mainly affects the side quests and mini-fortress battles, where another captain may respawn in an area you just killed the mini-fortress captain. Therefore, creating an endless captain respawn loop if you decide to kill the respawned captains. It does affect the main quests, but to a smaller degree. Regardless, enemies should respawn only after the area is left. 
- Loading - Occasionally, the loading screen would hang. When I alt+tab out and back into the game, it seamed to fix it.

Other thoughts:
Unfortunately, I feel that if you've played Shadow of Mordor, you've played Shadow of War. The game is just way too similar to its predecessor (same overall gameplay, similar storyline, same level-up grind fest, same animations, same in-game assets, same captain strengthes/weakness, same captain menu, same generic enemies, mostly the same dominated mounts... etc). This game kind of feels like it should have been an expansion pack or DLC for Shadow of Mordor. It's not so much a new game with some fresh new features, but an old game that's been fleshed out. It feels like this: An author created a successful book. The fans wanted a sequel. The author takes his or her first book, adds in more detail, keeps everything else relatively the same, and releases it as a new sequel to the first. Would you pay for that? 
When it comes to Shadow of War, expect a different map with the same gameplay and a few minor game tweaks and army additions; otherwise, everything else just feels like icing on an already stale cake (I played Shadow of Mordor for 120+ hours, so I ate my fair share of this dessert already). 

Recommendations:
- If you've never played Shadow of Mordor: Buy it.
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor and loved it: Wait to buy it on discount.
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor and were expecting a revitalized game with some new enemies, new assets/animations, more purpose than building an army, or a new storyline: Don't buy it. 

Final thoughts:
- Visuals - 9/10
- Variety of Gameplay - 5/10
- Fun Factor - 6.5/10

377160,Fallout 4,12/11/2016,False,"The gunplay is nice. The crafting and armors and weapons are all nice. The world is neat to explore.

But damned if I don't have a laundry list of problems with this game.

The protagonist and main story is kind of boring, all the dialogue options are severely limited to the point of making conversation in this game irrelevant, theres very few interesting, non-generated world quests. After a while, the game just starts to feel boring and repetitive.

Maybe that wouldn't even be a problem if it wasn't supposed to be a Fallout game. In most previous interations of the series, it stressed being able to approach situations a variety of ways and playing the game in different ways. But it doesn't really feel like theres a need to do that in this game since all the conversation options feel basically arbitrary all most quest are randomly generated ""go and shoot these guys"". 

Even the new perks system feels boring and unvaried. It feels like very few things in it actually alter the way you play the game.

Maybe if I wanted to play a game about going and shooting dudes that would be okay, but not what I wanted out of a Fallout game.

TL:DR 

Pros: Exploration, Gunplay
Cons: Uninteresting dialogue, meaningless choices, eventually repetitive gameplay, perk system not fun.

EDIT!:

This edit is occuring a few months after the initial review.

Perhaps at the time I was being unfair to Fallout 4. Do I enjoy the game? Not as much as I'd like, but I still think I should give a stronger points in its favor for fairness.

While you are hit with procedurely generated quest pretty early in the game, not all of the quests are like this. In fact, a lot of the world still has the quirky humor that the Fallout series is loved for, with things such as the Silver Shroud or USS Constitution quests. And some features in the game are improvements from previous interations, such as the power armor, crafting or armor systems in the game.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Fallout series and I do appreciate some of the steps this game was trying to take, I just think some of the things worked out better than others. I just think some of the things Bethesda tried to accomplish resulted in a game that didn't quite feel Fallout to me.

Also:

A lot of people have pointed out that I haven't played enough of the game to really get a full grasp of what I'm talking about.

I do sympathize with your point: I should be willing to explore more aspects of a game before writting it off.

But at the same time, if I'm 20 hours into a game and still think my over all impression is moderate enjoyment at best, then that probably has more to do with my personal tastes in games.

252490,Rust,1/17/2014,True,"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.

Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.

I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.

Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.

Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.

570940,DARK SOULS: REMASTERED,5/24/2018,False,"Right. Told you I would update this review. Get your reading face ready. Stretch your eyelids or splash some water on them, I dunno drink some water I guess. Water is good for you. 

Let's begin by adressing the cheating issue. In my original review I said ""Cheaters are already infesting the game and getting legitimate players banned from online through invasions."". Now upon further examination of the issue it seems I may have been following a wave of misinformation. Let me explain. Yes, there are cheaters. They are invading players and killing them instantly, putting various crippling debuffs on them and breaking their equipment. Apparently there are ways to back up your save file regularly to help deal with this issue. Obviously that is a bit of a hassle and should not be required but it is something that you can do. 

Now the real question. Are they getting legitimate players banned from participating online? The answer is... Yes and maybe not? Yes, because you can definitely get softbanned if you pick up a modified item dropped by someone else such as armor and weapons with impossible upgrades. Maybe not, because apparently there is no good evidence of people being softbanned for being killed by a cheater. Bottom line, always be careful about picking up items dropped by other players and back up your save files regularly if you want to play online without the risk of having your character messed up. I can't 100% guarantee that this is enough to keep your character safe but given the limited information that has been gathered it seems like the best course of action at the moment if you want to play online. 

By the way, you might be wondering what a softban is. Basically, your game is messed up in a way that the anticheat is able to detect and it prevents you from matching up with the general playerbase and instead only lets you play with other people who have been caught by this system. It is usually not clear when this occurs to you which is why it is hard to provide evidence for how and when this happens. It seems that you may be able to remove a softban by deleting the affected items or character and waiting for a certain amount of time. Could be false though. The information on this is unfortunately scarce and unreliable. 

TL;DR Back up your saves regularly, do not pick up items dropped by strangers and you might be ok playing online. Maybe. Hopefully.

Now as for the rest of the game, it is Dark Souls. Great game. My favorite since 2011. This time it comes with some changes such as the ability to rebind your jump button and holding up or down on the D pad to select your favorite spell/item. Neat.

The graphics have... changed? I've seen maybe 25% of this game so far and it is very very similiar. Hard to tell what is new, which is kind of a good thing I suppose. The differences that really stick out are the spell/fire/lightning effects which I actually think are quite pretty, so there is that. 

There is one visual change that is bothering me and that is the bonfire. Just as I said before ""It goes from being iconic to generic and is actually lore breaking because it is supposed to be a magical flame."" Most people playing the game today will just shrug at me like ""why would you even care lol who cares what it looks like"" because they just want to play online and slay bosses but I really value the artistic integrity of this game and to see crucial visual elements be tampered with in such an offhanded way just makes me feel sad inside. I think that if you remaster or remake a game you should keep the visuals as close to the original vision as possible.

Performance is solid for me. [spoiler] Blighttown finally running at 60fps [/spoiler] might be the highlight of this remaster so far. Looking at other reviews people seem to be having issues on certain configurations so I will recommend a bit of caution. No problems here though.

They changed matchmaking. Your weapon upgrade level now appears to be a factor. Doesn't really solve twinking (invading low levels) because you can still get overpowered unupgraded equipment and makes it more of a hassle to create planned midlevel invasion builds.

So, should you get this game? My view is that if you have not played Dark Souls, you should. It is one of the best games I have played. If you have a PS4, consider getting that version since it is much harder to cheat on that system. I won't be doing that because I can't justify paying full price + PS Plus for online. PC is fine though. Just back up your saves. In the event that you get softbanned you could still finish the game. For a veteran like myself though, even with the 50% discount on the PC version I find it to be a hard sell. What I wanted most of all from this game was a smoother running game with a revived online playerbase. Sure, I kinda got that. But what I also got were a bunch of unnecessary band-aid changes like the matchmaking and a tacked on anticheating system that punishes victims of cheating.

In essence, this remaster is fine. It should have been better. Dark Souls deserves better. If there was a sideways thumb rating then that is what I would have given it but there isn't. Because of the poor anticheat, adding inconveniences to matchmaking and tampering with the games original vision I will stick with my negative rating.

306130,The Elder Scrolls Online,5/29/2015,True,"EDIT: Since the time of this review, the game has ONLY improved leaps and bounds!

Below you will find a video of my first impressions with the game.

The game is very good. But here is the problem, most people come into it expecting Skyrim online. DO NOT DO THIS!

First let me get this out of the way, as this needs to be noted! 

If you look at the game as an MMO first and a TES game second you will not be disappointed. Others will look at the limitations compared to Skyrim or other TES single player games. Instead i look at the freedoms! I can loot just about every container i come across, i can go into pretty much every building i come across. Other mmo's don't do this. Other mmo's don't have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses. Someone else might say ""well i can't pick up everything like i can in Skyrim"" No you can't, but what mmo let's you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other games. 

The combat: You don't just stand in place watching cool downs! You have to react to your enemy, you have to block and dodge. You can't get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combat, you don't feel like you are slicing thin air anymore. 

The community: It's amazing! Everyone i have spoken to has been extremely friendly, eager to group up, eager to role play and get into character. No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you gold.

The crafting: It's just as much fun as other TES games, collecting the reagents you need isn't a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment with.

The world: The game looks great, it's not mind blowing great, but it does look good, especially for an MMO. This isn't going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it's no slouch either. The lighting is very well done but some textures can be bland. 

The customization: This is a big one! This game has a TON of customization options, dozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor type, there are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i've been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003. 

The crown store: It isn't pay to win! It's very similar to GW2 and there are only aesthetic options available. I was so pleased by this that i found myself WANTING to give them money in return for a cool looking mount, pet and costume. They don't pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that. You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own terms. 

I haven't experienced PvP yet and i haven't got to end game, i am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the world, enjoy your ascent!

In closing i will just say the game got a bad rep early on. Essentially people were paying for a beta until Tamriel Unlimited launched so i can understand their frustrations. But the game is in a MUCH better place now, i'm sure it's going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P!

Do you want to compete with Battlefield or LoL and Dota? Why? Instead of trying to become the new Starcraft or Company of Heroes. You dont even have to be a new groundbreaking game. But this? This is neither for core gamers or for casual players. 

But you are right! Dont listen to the fanbase, what do they know. Just slam together what you guys think is popular right now. The next thing i hear will be that you want to bring it to the ESL. Trying to make the die-hard fanbase happy is just to hard it seems.

Dawn of War 3 has nothing fun. The first time you call your Elites and done. The rest is just boring. Only the Orcs have a kind of interesting change but the first two games had at least some kind of strategy to it. Now it is just slamming the armies together and hoping for the best.

Marines look like they havent eaten since months, heroes are agile like hell. Just because Angelos is a hero does not mean he can just jump in a goddamn Terminator armor. Why remove surppression fire? Ah right, because units cant retreat anymore!
But in a retreat lies no honour! And they die like flies....

242920,Banished,3/2/2015,True,"Was doing great. The little town of Aviono, 20k food, 78 adults, around 12 children, and 15 years in. When the 16th year came around, it all went to hell. A fire started, burning one of the three storage barns stocked with food. I tried to get my little people to fight the fire with the wells nearby. They failed miserably and the other two barns caught fire, (this is about the time I realized putting all my food storages close together was a mistake). 

The fire started to spread to the wooden houses nearby, so I paused the game and looked up how to fight the damn fire. I figured out prioritizing the fire would help, so I did it and it did the trick. After the fire was put out, I checked out the damage. All my food gone and 5-6 houses destroyed. I knew my first priority should be to get my food back up to support my ever growing population of little people. 

This is where I realised I had made another mistake. Over 70% of my food was coming from potato farms, and guess what? All of my farms were right next to each other and an infestation started. Farm after farm were getting infected and loosing crops and I had no idea how to stop it. (I'm not one to go back and load and earlier save) So I paused it and looked it up, I couldn't find out how to stop it this time and I let it run it's course. Now the starvation began, and the graveyard began to fill up with little people's grave stones. It was too late to plant crops to get enough food to feed them all, so I basically gave up and watched everyone die a horrible death. I closed my eyes, mourning the loss of the little people that I had led around for so long. 

Then...I opened my eyes. I had three people still living! One 19 year old male and one 22 year old mother with her 6 year old male child. I had another chance to fix the broken city and save Aviono. This female was my last hope, unless I could get her with a female child, all was lost. So I set them to work tearing down the now unoccupied houses of the original Aviono, since I was almost completely out of materials.  I got them to live close to eachother and waited paitently untill....success! A female child was born. 

Life was good again. I set my new couple to tearing down everything not needed for materials and the future growth or Aviono. In the end, I had two stone houses, one of every type of resource production buildings, a town hall, and a cemetery (to remind me of the past mistakes). I got my population back up to 16 little people, and I sat back and sighed with relief. I had saved a town.


Then I realised that the new towns folk were all inbred children from the three survivors....",87093,1249,76561198107548100,1,18.67 hrs

782330,DOOM Eternal,3/21/2020,True,"[b][i]It's great, but don't go in expecting DOOM 2016[/i][/b]

**See bottom for TL;DR version and an update after some more play time.

[b]Oh boy, where to begin?[/b] Maybe I was a bit too hyped... But I was equally, if not more, hyped for [i]DOOM[/i] (2016) and that lived up to, and surpassed, expectations. I am fraggin' obsessed with Doom as a whole. Have been for a long time. As I did with 2016, I pre-ordered multiple copies of Eternal the very day it was an option. Different boxed copies, and one on Steam to play at launch. Excessive? Perhaps, but I love Doom, and I have never played a (official) Doom game I didn't like. I also like [i]Doom 3[/i], it's a good game, it's just different.

And so too, is Eternal. Like [i]Doom 3[/i], it's undoubtedly a worthy addition to the series, but, after beating it in a single marathon-run (don't let that fool you, it's a long game), I have to say, rather painfully, I liked 2016 better. Eternal is great, but also... unique.

Let me be clear, this is a good game. A great game. I won't go into too much detail about what the new mechanics are, since anyone reading this has probably already seen the videos. It's fast, frantic, violent as all hell, very mobile, and ripping and tearing through demon guts certainly got my heart racing. Crushing hellspawn feels just as visceral and satisfying as it ever has.

It's all glorious... it just doesn't feel quite like Doom. And I admit I have difficulty putting my finger on exactly why this is. 2016 felt like Doom. I loved 2016. I have over 500 hours in it for a reason. I've beaten it more times than I can remember on Nighare. It's just a beautiful game. The circle-strafing and dodging skills that I learned on [i]Ultimate Doom[/i] and [i]Doom II[/i] felt equally useful in 2016, plus it forced me to learn and master jumping and ledge grappling/mantling in a way that felt very fluid, without slowing down the action at all. 

On the other hand, [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] is less about classic FPS movement, and more about resource management. Where 2016 gives you a bunch of firepower and let you use it as you see fit, Eternal gives you a bunch of tools and pushes you to use them in a specific way. When they said, ""use the right tool for the job"" they weren't kidding. You basically have to. Don't try to improvise. Make sure you take out the demons in the right order to keep your resources up, or you're going to die since item placement on the map is few and far between. It's all about chainsawing the right demon at the right time.

Don't get me wrong, this is really fun. It certainly makes you think more than 2016. I can see the idea here is to force the player into learning these mechanics so well that they become automatic and no longer require conscious thought. It's like a gory FPS puzzle, with each encounter trying to guide you into taking out each demon in a certain pattern and with certain weapons. But, the flipside of that, arguably a downside, it feels less classic. I'm not annoyed that there's a dance to master here, but this dance sometimes requires a few too many steps. ([b]EDIT[/b]: Please see update at the bottom. After spending more time with this new combat system I've since changed my opinion. It may not be as oldschool, but it gets really addicting.)

To pick an example, I was under the impression that demon weak-points were going to be something you could attempt to exploit in the heat of battle to turn the tide, but no. You pretty much need to hit the weak points to keep the combat under control. This isn't entirely unlike 2016, which had certain weapon mods that were far better suited to certain enemies than others. This is a lot more focused though, and you will have to use all your tools to succeed. No more Plasma Stun + Super Shotgun as a cure-all.

It's a lot harder than 2016, too. I started on Nighare and gave up about midway through before switching to UV. I have no complaints about the difficulty here. 2016 feels a little too easy after a lot of hours. Ultra Violence in Eternal feels even harder than Nighare in 2016. Length wise, it took me about 18 hours to marathon the campaign, so it is a linear FPS of epic proportions.

On to presentation, the destructable demons are fantastic. They really fit the game. Watching chunks of meat fly off as you dish out bullets is just plain cool. There is an overwhelming amount of customization and upgrade potential. A lot of options, and having that much customization in a FPS campaign is extraordinarily rare. I would have to say I've NEVER seen an FPS campaign (linear, not open world) with this many options for customizing, both cosmetic and otherwise. And all the cosmetic changes you make are reflected in every single cutscene. None of them are pre-rendered.

Story wise, well, this is where my biggest disappoinent is. I won't go into spoilers, but I can sum it up by saying I guess nobody remembers that old quote from John Romero, ""there's no name for the Doom Marine because he's supposed to be you"". Well, they ditched that idea. The Doom Slayer is now, truly, his own character. (Minor-ish spoiler, at your own risk: [spoiler]He talks. Only briefly, but still. I was really, REALLY hoping that wouldn't happen. We have enough FPS protagonists that talk. I like the idea of the silent demon-slaying demigod, who spoke ONLY through actions. I hope I never hear him say another word. Didn't care for the ending either.[/spoiler]) I'd imagine this is a concept they're going to push even more in the DLC. I hope they don't. In Eternal, you'll see his past, and even see him wounded and dragged around by the Sentinels. That really bugged me. I liked it better when no one could touch him. 2016 implied that the Sentinels worshiped him as a leader. Now it seems like he's just their best knight. Sure, this is more believable I guess (as far as Doom goes anyway) than a literally unstoppable demon-slaying death machine, but, meh, I felt more powerful in 2016 when you answered to no one.

I don't want it to sound bad. Far from it, the heaps of positive reviews are not without reason. This game is fantastic. I just kind of wish they'd reserved a lot of these new ideas for Quake and let Doom be a bit more straightforward, as it's always been. I just want my guns and an army of demons to slay, I didn't need the cutscenes and backstory.

I still highly recommend it. It's worth every penny. It just doesn't pull at me quite the way [i]DOOM[/i] (2016) did, and still does. I like Eternal in the same way I like [i]Doom 3[/i]. It's Doom, it's just a different flavor of Doom. If [i]Ultimate Doom[/i] is Coke, then [i]DOOM[/i] is adding a shot of rum, and [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] is dumping it all out and getting a Sprite. Tasty, but not quite what I expected.

[b]**UPDATE[/b]
I want to amend my statements about the combat as I now feel I was too harsh on it. The more I play it, the more I love it. It's still different than the circle-strafing and dodging I'm so accustomed to from past Doom games, but I believe I over-stated how critical the weak-point system is. There's actually many different ways to go about each encounter, and once I learned the system better it feels a lot less restrictive and incredibly fun. It's both demanding, and rewarding. I love it.

Also, I want to address something as I had no idea how this review could be so controversial. This game is excellent. Compared to any shooter that isn't named Doom, it's the best. But ranked among Doom games, I personally wouldn't call it my favorite one of the series. It just doesn't have quite the same vibe 2016 did, and it feels a little more hand-holdy (yes, even with the tutorials and pop-ups turned off). Apparently I'm far from the only person who feels that way. Even with that said, it is absolutely worth buying at full price.

TL;DR version:

Game is good. Different from last game. More story. More cutscenes. Some will love, some will hate. You buy now.",15929,1640,76561198058396600,33,18.52 hrs

Draw your own conclusions.
















Since many of you wanted something of substance, Here's a little thing I threw together.

The game itself shows kinship to 4x games, you‚Äôre a new civ on the block with one planet and big dreams. To expand your people to the stars. You‚Äôll soon meet some other races, and realize your destiny to is befriend/ trade with / ignore/ exploit/ exterminate these new creatures. As you expand through use of colonies and strategically placed flags (also called frontier outposts by the humorless), you will work towards your goals for (insert goals here). This expansion will not go unnoticed, and you‚Äôre sure to make enemies and friends among the other races you‚Äôve encountered, whose visual appearance has almost no bearing on their preferred world. (Personally my closest ally is a bunch of Sea-warthogs, and I‚Äôm also trading partners with a race of desert penguins)



Combat is interesting. The number below your fleet tells you an idea of it‚Äôs strength, but not the whole story. You‚Äôd be tempted to think like CK2 or EU, where if you have the larger force and a good general you‚Äôre generally come out on top. But that‚Äôs not the case here. Just ask the 1st fleet of the United Nations of Earth. Armed to the teeth with anti-matter missiles, and assisted by several dozen ships of our fungi allies, up against a force less than 70% of their size.
You actually can‚Äôt ask them. They‚Äôre all pretty dead. Point defenses turned out to be pretty good at point defense. So remember to not put all your eggs in one basket. Or Spores in one pouch, as the fungi say. Some missiles, some laser, spread the wealth.




Diplomacy is fairly straight forward. You get along better with races that have similar morals to your own, and especially xenophiles in general, but through enough effort you can even getting along with xenophobes. (Those desert penguins mentioned above are kind of racists, but we get along alright). Embassies are a big help. Alliances can be pretty easily formed with those you get along with, and are a great way to both protect yourself and to make offensive wars easier. When declaring war as part of an alliance everyone has to approve it. This is made easier by distributing the war goals amongst the members. Basically a planet to the sea hogs, a liberation to the fungi, etc. Thankfully defensive wars are automatic. You can‚Äôt leave them hanging.



The science and tech tree is a bit different from most because it‚Äôs not really a tree. It‚Äôs a set of cards you draw that you ‚Äòdraw‚Äô three from and then decide which to work on. But my favorite part is definitely the science ships. You‚Äôre essentially playing as the Enterprise, boldly going where no one has gone before(star trek theme plays here). You‚Äôll run into all sorts of anomalies that require investigation. Sometimes it‚Äôs a whole story line about precursors, sometimes it‚Äôs just an old cruiser stuck on a planet. Sometimes you run into a system full of million year old mining drones and have to book it. It keeps things interesting. 

The random events are very much what we‚Äôve come to expect from paradox. A perfect mix of good writing and humor. Even the ol‚Äô comet event comes around in it‚Äôs orbit.



TLDR: It‚Äôs a really interesting take on 4x that is everything you should expect from Paradox, and sure to get better with time, and DLCs. A little difficult to learn at first but better than their other games.

TLDR-2: Just play it.",41897,1340,76561198073099800,8,18.38 hrs
648350,Jurassic World Evolution,6/16/2018,False,"In its current state, it pains me to have to advise against a purchase. I myself loved Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis (JP:OG) and when Jurassic World: Evolution (JW:E) came out I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this game too, but unfortunately JW:E is surpassed or matched by JP:OG in every regard, with the exception of graphics and dinosaur diversity.

This is a bare-boned shell of a Park Simulator game. There are no guest needs or personality. You wouldn't even know there were guests if it weren't for sudden cashflow, as soon as dinosaurs make an apperance in your park. I grant you, there are the guest sprites, but thats all there is (I once had apparently more than 12.000 guests in my park and it didn't feel any different from having no guests in my park).

To sum up what major issues annoy me (excluding the everyday pet peeves):

- EXTREMELY shallow simulation of guests (they barely qualify as entities for this game)
- You are restricted to 5 small, claustrophobic islands for your normal gameplay and 1 claustrophobic island for a sandbox mode (they aren't even true islands, just cordoned off areas in an island skybox)
- There is no day/night cycle
- Only 3 real attractions (2 different viewing platforms and the gyrospheres (the equivalent of a fast-food restaurant doesn't constitute an attraction for me))
- No in-depth dinosaur AI (a simplistic general beavioural model with no herd/pack behaviour)
- Limited (and hence repetitive animations)
- Weirdly timed, often unfitting and repetitive (annoying) voice overalys
- A cluttered UI, making tasks like resupplying the feeders, treating a dino, etc extremely tedious
- Fences becoming useless as soon as a dino is uncomfortable (a 150kg raptor can apprently break (not scale) an electrified heavy steel fence without taking damage or being deterred)
- No customization for park buildings, no decorations, etc
- You can't kill your dinos (you can tranq and then sell them, but that is a tedious, time-consuming and a sometimes bugged process)
- Genetic modification has no apparent impact on dino behaviour or abilities (except increasing some numbers)
- Contracts are sometimes nonesensical with how the other factions disapprove of them (Science division wanted to not have any Carnivores eating guests for 10 min, but apparently that is something that the Security and Entertainment division disagreed with, as 10 min without any carnivores feasting on my guests put me in disfavor with the those factions)
- Sometimes you are also offered contracts which you cannot fulfil on your current island (and contracts don't carry to other islands)
- A shallow research system. Aside from unlocking new fences, variations on the fast-food store (gift shop, etc) and 2 of the 3 visitor attraction, it is pretty much just filler, just useless upgrades to improve some stuff here and there


The few truely good things about this game are the cosmetic customization of dinos, dino diversity, the graphics and dino rendering and that is just not enough to make a game. Especially considering this game was developed by the same studio, that developed Planet Coaster, this game is at its current version an embarassing failure and will only be enjoyable after considerable changes. This just feels like a rushed product to make the E3 deadline.",10729,1093,76561198028092100,31,18.35 hrs

275850,No Man's Sky,9/10/2019,False,"I respect the hell out of what Hello Games has done to improve the state of this game. I played it at launch, and I played it again any time a major expansion released and each time it has gotten better and better. In its current state, there is much more to do, there are places to explore and a storyline to follow, and a ""point"" to gathering all of the materials: base building, upgrades, and more. For that, it is commendable - and I certainly appreciate a new space VR game to take some time out of Elite. 

But this is still not a game that I can recommend. Hello Games has addressed the problem of there being nothing to do in the game but have failed to fix basic issues that keep turning me away from the game each time that I come back to it. These include: 

[list]
    [*] [b]Terrain pop-in.[/b] A game as massive as this will need to manage draw distance in some way, I understand that. What I cannot forgive is mountains and trees that change shape drastically several times as I fly toward them, or even worse appear out of thin air giving me no time to crash into them. Which leads me directly into: 
    [*] [b]The wishy-washy flight model.[/b] Ships fishtail around in the sky and don't differ meaningfully from each other in terms of handling, acceleration and features. Ships auto-accelerate and never fully stop, making it difficult to perform precise maneuvers. The game also babies you and tries its best to not let you crash into terrain. You have to be so precise with your aim in space combat that it is almost impossible to line up shots in a consistent manner. It just [i]doesn't feel good[/i] to be in my spaceship in this game, whether in first or third-person view and in a game that is ostensibly about exploring the universe, this is unforgivable. To be clear: I don't want Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen levels of realism in the flight model but I want to do ill-advised stunts through archways in the terrain, and juke enemies in an asteroid field and I want to do it all in a ship that feels responsive and accurate. 
    [*] [b]The Color Palette and planet generation.[/b] Very, [i]very[/i] few planets that I have come across thus far have been interesting. Sure, there are neat plants and things to explore but 9/10 planets feel drab, lifeless, and marred by drastic color contrasts or uninteresting palettes. In the game I recently started, I went to a Red Planet, a Pink Planet, a Beige Planet, a Green Planet, another Red Planet, and finally another Beige Planet. None of them offered landscapes that were particularly interesting. Nothing I wanted to build a base on let alone explore for more than a few minutes to find the resources I need, and then get back off. Combined with the pop-in issues and generally unimpressive effects, textures and lighting I don't ever want to remain planetside for longer than I have to.

There should not be performance issues and yet when interacting with Knowledge Stones, entering aospheres and at random points throughout the game I experience stutter, missed inputs and general frame drops. This isn't in VR, it's not in 4K, and my system usage isn't maxing out when this happens either. 
    [*] [b] Inventory Management.[/b] My God almighty this is unimpressive. The layout of your... what is it... six? seven maybe? separate inventories/technology layouts is unintelligible, clunky and difficult to manage on a controller. Simple as that, it's bad. There have been updates addressing the most common QoL complaints but it needs a revamp from the bottom up to keep up with all the upgrades, separate materials and crafting components. It's way too small and way too hard to manage. 
[/list]

I will keep coming back to No Man's Sky every time there is an update. I really want this game to be great. I share Hello Games' vision of a ""Chill exploration experience,"" letting off steam laid back with my controller or with my headset captaining a ship through an exotic, surreal galaxy. But it cannot be [i]chill[/i] if I'm constantly managing my inventory. I don't want to [i]explore[/i] when every planet is uninteresting and graphical glitches abound. And it's not a good [i]experience[/i] when I don't enjoy flying in my spaceship or dealing with performance issues. 

This game is worth keeping up with, and not worth giving up on. I don't think I ever will. I am impressed by how far it has come and am just waiting for that last extra step before I will enjoy it.",55445,1029,76561198021247400,5,18.28 hrs

[h1][u] General Impression [/u][/h1]
Bioshock Infinite was originally going to be more of an open world game with a variety of features but with disagreements in development accompanied with the limitations the product was facing on other platforms, they decided to scrap most of what they were working on to create the version you see before you. The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer.

Not every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game. Sure, any one of these features would have been great additions and dispite of the downgrade, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite if the price is right.",95310,4831,76561198306726200,34,18.13 hrs
543900,METAL GEAR SURVIVE,2/25/2018,False,"I came into this game with an open mind, hoping that it would end up being a case similar to Metal Gear Rising, a Metal Gear spinoff that everyone thought was going to suck but ended up turning out great.

This ended up not being the case

As a gamer and a consumer I am willing to forgive certain practices if it means I can get a quality product, I was willing to tolerate the microtransactions, I was willing to tolerate the grindy and tedious gameplay, I was willing to forgive a story that isn't amazing like every other Metal Gear Solid game.

But one thing I CANNOT tolerate, is this kind of always-online DRM.

Now, when I say ""Always-Online"" I mean if you lose connection for even a second in the middle of a mission in single player, it boots you back to the main menu. This means that if you have poor access to internet, which most people around the world still do, it makes this game borderline unplayable at times. 

I am willing to forgive many sins Konami, but this is the same exact shit that made me hate Sim City 2013. I refuse to tolerate games that require you to have a stable internet connection TO PLAY SINGLE PLAYER.

That having been said, this game could've been something really good, and it is almost there, what you have is a top-tier survival game held back by greedy business practices by a short-sighted games publisher.

I was granted a refund for this game, but in the event that Konami decides to remove the Always-Online DRM for single player, I am willing to buy this game again in the future and play it.

As it stands, I cannot recommend",65004,1958,76561198003998900,13,18.10 hrs
782330,DOOM Eternal,3/23/2020,False,"I've been a fan of the DooM series for the past 25 years. I loved Doom 2016. I wanted it to succeed so that iD, as a company, would survive. I was overjoyed when it did.
Nevertheless, I cannot overestimate how disappointed I am with Doom Eternal.

First, credit where credit is due. The music is really good and the graphics are amazing. Some of the levels look absolutely phenomenal. Tons of fan service.
You can also bypass a few obnoxious Weapon Mastery Challenges with Weapon Mastery Tokens. The combat is meaty, packs a punch and can be very satisfying.

Now onto my issues.

Excessive platforming: I understand the devs wanted to make exploration / non-combat gameplay more creative with the platforming, but they overdid it so much that it becomes a pain and a chore very fast. This is coming from a person who loves both Mirror's Edge games - games where the platforming is the entire gameplay. However, ME's did it well; something that I cannot say about Doom Eternal. Quite often you wonder where to jump next. Some of the jumps require absolutely perfect double jump, dash, dash combo timing in order to reach ledges. Regularly, I had issues with Doom Guy either not grabbing climbable walls by himself, or grabbing them unexpectedly, at which point I pressed the Use key myself in order to grab them, which in turn caused me to let go of the walls. Frustrating to say the least. What's worse, platforming makes up approximately 30% of the whole game. This makes me miss the long, 'boring' (i.e. beautifully looking, aospheric and full of little details) corridors they were attempting to replace.
 
Entire combat loop: I am all for changing the combat a bit, but Eternal's combat is overdesigned and bloated with pointless mechanics that nobody asked for:
- Why add dashes? Nobody asked for them. What's worse, in order to balance things out, they reduced the player's movement speed. What was the point then? Also, they are on a cooldown.
- They added a super powerful Blood Punch, but nerfed the regular punch so much that it barely does any damage. Also, it's on a cooldown (i.e. to be precise, it requires 2 Glory Kills to fill).
- Flame Belch's (or Flame Puff as it should be called) one and only reason for existing is giving you Armor. The fire does not have any other effect on the enemies: they do not panic, they do not receive any debuff. I don't think they even receive any damage and if they do, it is so marginal, that it makes absolutely no difference. And it's on a cooldown.
- Ice Bomb. An actually cool addition. Pun intended. On a cooldown.
- Frag Grenade. Better than the one in Doom 2016, especially after upgrades. On a cooldown.
- Chainsaw is now required to spam, in order not to run dry after firing your gun a couple of times: this is due to the fact that bigger enemies (anything that is not pure cannon fodder) are much more spongy than in Doom 2016 and you can carry even less ammo than in that game. In Doom 2016 I used it more as a f*ck-this-demon-in-particular button and the ammo was a bonus. Here, you very rarely have the opportunity to do so, since you have to use it constantly to replenish ammo, which in turn causes you not to have enough fuel for the larger demons. Also, guess what: it recharges one pip of fuel i.e. it's on a cooldown.

See a pattern here? In order to be effective, you need to manage 6 (!) cooldowns as if it's an MMO. Doom 2016 had only one, since all the equipment items shared their cooldown.
Now, the entire combat cycle can be summed up like this:
1. Shoot at non cannon fodder demons
2. Run out of ammo after a minute
3. Run around looking for cannon fodder enemies, which die to a strong fart
4. Set them on fire, maybe freeze them (when desperate for health), chainsaw them
5. If you get damaged badly, skip to step 3.
Rinse and repeat. Add some Glory Kills during this cycle.

The combat loop changes a bit when the Marauder comes along:
1. Shoot at non cannon fodder demons while avoiding the Marauder
2. Run out of ammo after a minute while avoiding the Marauder
3. Run around looking for cannon fodder enemies while avoiding the Marauder
4. Set them on fire, maybe freeze them (when desperate for health), chainsaw them while avoiding the Marauder
5. If you get damaged badly, skip to step 3, while avoiding the Marauder
6. Once everything is dead aside from the Marauder, focus on him
7. Change your entire behavior that this, and the previous game, have taught you, by standing still and looking for a slight opening when the Marauder's eyes glow green, because this is a 1v1 fighting game now for some reason
8. Repeat step 7 until either of you is dead

Marauder's design is puzzling to me. As mentioned above, in order for you to be effective against him, you need to do everything opposite to what this series has taught you. Mind you, I'm not talking about the difficulty here: once you discover that you can use a quick SSG-Ballista-SSG combo on him, he stops being so intimidating. It's just he brings the entire pacing of the game to a screeching halt, more so than the platforming sections. You can't stay at long range because he throws axe slashes at you. You can't stay at close range because he shoots the SSG at you. You can't stay at midrange, the one designed to be his weakness, because he may still frigging use his ranged axe or SSG or spam you with wolves for no bloody reason. Oh, and you can't use any Super Weapon against him (unless you are lucky and he spazzes out), because people would just blow him away with a BFG, and rightly so. The designer's wanted to create a cool, challenging enemy, instead they created a personification of everything I dislike in this game. And therein lies the problem.

The fundamental issue with this game is the fact that it forces you play in a specific way. Previous games gave you the tools and said ""go and have fun!"". All guns were, more or less, effective. Yes, this ended up with a lot of people cheesing their way with the SSG and Gauss Cannon, but why prevent them from doing so? If they have fun doing it, why stop them? The devs wanted to prevent this behavior and changed their philosophy to ""play exactly like we tell you to play or die"". There is no experimentation, no fun discovery. You are literally told what to do against each enemy in a small tutorial screen. And if you fail to adhere to these instructions? Well, this is the reason that the bigger enemies are so damn bullet spongy when not fighting them the 'correct' way.

But you know what is the saddest thing in this whole situation? You can still cheese with the SSG, Rocket Launcher and Ballista (stand in for the Gauss Cannon), though now only to a certain extent. This is still the most effective way of fighting, especially on higher difficulties! So despite all of their effort, changing the entire combat flow, adding tons of pointless abilities and annoying enemies, they still failed to prevent cheesing. Pair this with the sucky platforming sections and you have the ultimate failure of design: attempting to approach minor issues with a frenzied exaggerated knee-jerk reaction akin to taking a sledgehammer to a porcelain vase.

Now I have buyer's remorse. I pre-ordered the $100+ Deluxe Edition. Sucks to be me, I guess. The worst of all is I know that Doom Eternal is going to sell exceedingly well and, due to this, they will never go back to their previous design philosophy. They will continue on with the current one and I will not be able to enjoy a new Doom game again. Very melodramatic I know, but this is the future I predict and accept. Time to move on.

:edit:

I forgot how the Prowler acts and looks similar to the Imp and it's easy to accidentally mistake him for an Imp in the heat of action then attempt to Chainsaw him only to discover you need 3 pips of fuel.
Then they somehow made the Archvile even more annoying compared to Doom 2. Now that is an achievement.

417290,Ghost of a Tale,3/19/2018,False,"Anyone who knows me would tell you that this game is basically made for me... and not *just* because of the amazingly cute protagonist (though honestly that would have been enough to get me to buy it in and of itself). When I get to play as an amazingly well animated character like that, my enjoyment of a game immediately goes up considerably... yet even with that taken into consideration, I can't recommend this game.

I'm sure this review will get buried beneath the slew of positive reviews with <5 hours of playtime, but for the few folks who actually see this, I hope I can shed some light on the things they aren't telling you.

The art direction in this game? Inspired. It's clear that a huge amount of effort went into creating well-crafted, well-animated art assets and the love that the modelers and artists had for this product shows. It's by far the best thing about the game. The first half or so of the game's world is incredibly well done - detailed, stylized, believable... I was feeling quite fully immersed in this world and its characters and the story. So what changed?

If I had to guess, I'd say the developers got about half way through making this thing and got bored, or ran out of time, or ran out of money, or something, and just scraped the second half together. There are bugs - holy shit are there bugs - and some of them systematically dismantle the experience from its core.

Anyone who only played the first 3-5 hours of the game probably never encountered any of this, and will read this and think I'm crazy for not recommending this game, and if I'd only played 3-5 hours, I'd be right there with them, but once you get to the middle / end of the game, the lack of polish becomes readilly apparent. Holes in the world geometry abound. Leaving the pathways and going to explore the outdoor areas of the game - particularly the 'Shore' area - is just asking to fall through the world. It's clear to me that basically no testing was done in this regard, because you don't even have to try to do it. Luckily, when you fall through the world, the game puts you back on the surface - or, it tries to. All three times this happened to me, the game put me back under the world and created a loop of falling - respawning - falling that forced me to alt+F4 the game and restart it again to continue.

A lot of sounds are just flat out missing. Music exists in some areas and not others, and when you transition between them the music track starts playing in the middle and is quite jarring. There are events that should have sounds associated with them (ringing bells, for instance, or combat happening mere feet from your character) which make no sounds at all. Coincidentally these sounds are primarily missing from the second half of the game - see a theme developing here? No dialog is voiced, and some of it really could have used it. In fact, there's no cutscenes of any kind except the ending which only qualifies by the barest definition of a cutscene, and while the sounds that *do* exist are very well done and really add considerably to the experience, the ones that are missing will pull you out of the game and destroy your immersion.

Speaking of dialog, dialog loops and sequence breaks frequently create nonsensical situations. I'm going to try to be spoiler-free here in case, after reading this, you still want to play this, but there's an encounter near the end of the game wherein a rather monumental event takes place, and a number of guards in the prison the game takes place in watch it happen (or... should, in theory? They were standing literally 10 feet from it...). They then proceed to not react to it in the slightest. This may not sound terribly egregious, and without major story spoilers I can't really illustrate why it is, but trust me when I say that it's completely immersion destroying.

Hopefully you don't just click through the dialog and skip that monumentous story event, but if you do, it's okay - after the event takes place, you can go and talk to an unconcious character and the game will *play the entire event again as if it never happened*, with unconcious characters talking to you, conversation repeating, and those characters getting knocked unconcious again. This is clearly not intended.

The final encounter in the game is the most uninspired, infuriating thing I've experienced in recent memory. Imagine that you're playing Mario, and you're comfortable with the mechanics of Mario and how the game operates, and then in the last level, the game switches to the N64 Superman game. This is the closest approximation of this shit-show that I can make without completely spoiling the story, but but let me assure you that it is utterly ridiculous how contrived it feels. Not only that, but you're required to utilize some objects to complete the encounter. There's about... 8 of them, if I had to estimate, and when you use one, they're consumed. You need to use 3 of them successfully to proceed (why is it always three in these situations? It's like the magic number of gaming bosses.) Here's the rub - if you fail the encounter, and use the 'Load Last Save' prompt that you're given when you do, any of those objects that you used previously *are still gone*. On my third attempt at this steaming pile of an encounter (which I should add is basically a die roll as to whether you can successfully do it, due to a restrictive timer mechanism and utterly unpredictably laughable AI), there were only two of these objects left, and I had to close the game entirely and re-load it to try again.

The ending... well, let it suffice to say that there is no conclusion to the story. It's basically a 'To be continued...', but there's not enough content there for it to conceivably have been a cash grab to promote a sequel... it honestly feels like they got to the end of the game and decided to just not include any real conclusion. In fact, at the end of the game, things are *more nebulous than when it started*, which is kind of a feat in and of itself.

They had a few golden opportunities for branching storylines and a satisfying ending here. There were three scenarios I was speculating would be the end as I was playing, and I was excited to see if my speculation was correct - I would have been better off just not playing the last 20 minutes of the game and writing my own ending, instead. This lack of story wrap-up combined with utterly ridiculous immersion destroying game system choices (dialog is all handled via the game's equivalent of popup boxes, which pause everything else while they're taking place, and the game decides to, while you're being chased by multiple NPCs who're actively trying to kill you, suddenly pull you into a 5-6 line dialog between three characters... on MULTIPLE occasions... in the span of 2-3 minutes, during this ending...) completely ruined the amazing experience that the first 5ish hours of this game brings.

If you feel you must play this game, I wholeheartedly recommend that you stop when you reach the Shore area for the first time. Maybe even the Slopes, because that's where the problems really start becoming apparent. Just stop there, write your own ending in your head, and suffice to say that no matter how ridiculous your version of events is, it will be better than what the team behind this thing actually decided to include.

TL;DR: Bugs. Sequence breaks. Frustrating design choices. Ruined immersion. First 3-5 hours are amazing, one of the best gaming experiences I've had in the past few years. The second half of the game is a smoldering dumpster fire with little hope for redemption. You've been warned.",19223,1151,76561197999552500,36,17.93 hrs

On the 25th of March,1 month after my purchase and after being rejected for 4 times (and not asking for a refund for the 5th time) steam just magically decided to refund me the game, out of nowhere! Now why did they do this now and not when I asked them to do for 4 times, I don't really know, but i have a strong guess: this review getting over 1500 upvotes and ESO being on a free weekend, so this reivew has hurt ESO's reputation very, very badly.

So well, yeah, you can get a refund eventhough you have more than 2+ play time if you point out the fact that you have been downloading 140GBs for 17 hours. But there is one slight problem: If you don't have a review rocketing over 1500 upvotes chances are you are not getting a refund ;) However, I thank the people on steam for atleast looking at the reviews and giving some damn about us, sincerely, thank you. (If you wish to know what caused all this, you are free to read below)


Warning!
If you play this game and do not like it, there are NO REFUNDS.

That is because as of 24.02.2018, steam downloads 66 GBs on it's own, after that download is finished, ESO's own launcher opens up and downloads 80 MORE GBs, and all the time this 2nd download counts towards your in-game time since the launcher is working. And unless you have NASA level internet speed, you will exceed the 2 hour refund limit without even playing the game. I asked for a refund from steam, not once or twice but for 3 times, I explained them the 2nd download situation - tons of topics about that on the internet btw so they KNOW it- and I don't even think they read my emails, my tickets, or anything.

367520,Hollow Knight,6/22/2017,True,"There aren't many games that have cast a longer shadow over the industry than Dark Souls, and much like what you'll find lurking within them it's been a bit of a curse. Too many indie games have been overtuned to provide a similarly punishing experience, narratives have been undercooked to mimic the subtle storytelling, and action has been slowed to a crawl to imitate the methodical combat. But some titles have taken the right bits of inspiration and mixed them with their own brew of mechanics, and from just such a concoction you will find Hollow Knight. And in many ways, the mix Team Cherry has come up with is a richer taste than what inspired it.

Hollow Knight is the tale of a little bug in a big, dark, scary world of bugs. It's bugs all the way down, you see; the kingdom of Hallownest was once a great and powerful society, spread across deep warrens beneath the surface. But something went wrong long ago and the kingdom fell silent. Now only the tiny hamlet of Dirouth remains to mark its location, though recently bugs have found themselves drawn to the lost kingdom in search of something. You will follow them down there, meet them, battle them and the unknown denizens, and change the fate of the cursed kingdom forever.

Pretty heavy stuff, right? Hollow Knight gets that, and that's one of its first and most prominent achievements. The tone this title strikes is both unique and flawless, an unexpected mix of charm, despair, humor, and dread. You've probably noticed already that your little dude is absolutely adorable, nipping along with his little white mask and nail. The other bugs nice enough to speak to you are often just as cute, but sometimes have sinister edges to them, or in a few cases are downright creepy. Friendly critters may crack jokes or help you out, while others relay ominous portends or warn you of the many dangers in and around Hallownest.

This balance carries on to the environments in a big way. The game world is massive for a metroidvania, and each area has a distinct style and aosphere that hits all the right notes to evoke powerful reactions. From the first area of dark caves and ruins you may end up in a lush grotto of vines and creatures, a pleasant change until you realize the water is acidic and every bush may hide terrible dangers. Or you could descend into the caverns of potent fungi, with mysterious, bulbous foes that must be approached with great caution. Later journeys take you to decaying cities, silent graveyards, bustling coliseums, desolate wastes, and two of the most horrifyingly oppressive places I have ever visited in a video game. I'm not kidding here, Hollow Knight has topped titles from Half-life to SOMA in crafting locations that give me relentless anxiety.

Another achievement worth mentioning is how Hollow Knight can craft such an aosphere without hobbling the player in how they approach it. Part of the Dark Souls experience is trundling around at a slow jog, fighting battles and dodging traps at a measured pace. Team Cherry wisely elected to ignore this aspect of their inspiration, instead making your little knight swift, nimble, and refreshingly responsive. The controls here are tight, allowing you to execute your dashes and sword swings with ease as you dance around bugs both great and small, airborne and grounded, armed and fanged. At no point was I frustrated with the pace at which I could move about, and the fluid motion made the elaborate and creative battles against bosses and larger enemies all the more enjoyable.

As a metroidvania there's a wealth of hidden items and powers to scrounge up across the world as well. Some are common pieces of the genre like health and magic upgrades, weapon skills and wall climbing and such. But even here there are unique implementations, like one of your earliest powers being essentially unlimited horizontal flight. Uncovering this treasure so early on feels incredibly liberating and exciting, but also reveals to you just how important verticality is to the game. You can further augment your movement and combat with charms that can extend your sword reach, change how you move when hit or attacking, or grant you all sorts of additional effects. I will admit a little disappoinent here at how essential some charms are over others and how the limited slots for them tend to keep me from experimenting much, though.

I suppose I could gripe about a few other annoyances, like the rare bug I get where my charged attacks don't work, or how spread out the fast travel is. That latter one is a bit of a pain in truth, because the stations used for fast travel tend to be quite far from points of interest. You certainly won't be relying on them as much as you would Castlevania warp rooms or Dark Souls bonfire warps. The map is another aspect that could be a drag, but honestly I love it. You don't fill in new areas of the map until you reach a save point, and to get a map at all you have to locate an amateur cartographer in each area. He tends to be near one of the logical entrances and has audio and visual cues to lead you to him, so there's a bit of tension in each new locale as you seek him out.

It's details like the map that make me love the game more, really. Hallownest isn't just a maze to run around, it's a functioning world with its own rules and requirements. The things Hollow Knight asks you to do are never unreasonable and fit with the dark and unusual tone of the places you visit. Nothing is out of place here, and it all works in concert to immerse you in this strange world of bugs and mysticism. The characters and locations are far more memorable to me than those of similar games, in large part because they can be funny or creepy or adorable and still fill their role in a seamless narrative. There's a lot to unpack about Hallownest, but instead of just resting on riddles this game makes you WANT to puzzle it out.

On top of everything that Hollow Knight does right, it looks and sounds absolutely breathtaking. The hand-drawn aesthetic gives the enemies and environments an extra spark of life, complimenting the strong lines and flat colors with impressive animated details. The environments in particular are labors of love that bring together careful linework, bold lighting, and rich particle effects to make them feel deep and authentic. And the sound design does just as well, with appropriately subtle, melancholy melodies and impactful effects. There's so much going on here that it baffles me how it could all work together so perfectly and yet it does, on and on for easily 20 hours or more. Hollow Knight does what few games manage to do, take clear inspiration from classics and find its own way to surpass them.

What kills me about Undertale is that it's hard to review. It's hard to review here, it's hard to review anywhere a numerical rating system is employed, to say nothing of a binary one. First and foremost, if there was an option to place this in a more gray area in terms of ratings, I'd absolutely do so. Undertale has a lot of heart and effort put into it, but as of writing this there's at least three hundred people who here who could've told you that. I've followed this game since the demo and have all the love and respect in the world for devs like Toby and what they do. If anything, they're role models who I dream of emulating one day and making my own work that can be so impactful. Hopefully, with that all said, I've made my intent clear enough to lower the  pitchforks and torches long enough to plea my case here. I've decided against trying to categorize anything here as good or bad, because the thing is that many features could be virtues or flaws depending on the individual.

[b] The Basics[/b]
[list]
[*]The ratio of dollars to hours is a little shaky, if that's a big selling point for you. I just narrowly broke even after doing a completionist run of (assumedly) the best ending.
[*]I experienced no crashes nor bugs, at worst I saw exactly one spelling error, which I'm sure could be taken care of hastily, so in those terms, very professional quality standard overall.
[*] If you can help it, absolutely do [u]NOT[/u] use a guide. Undertale is an experience, your first playthrough at least should be as fresh and genuine as you can make it. Figuring out what choices do and don't have this or that impact will greatly take away from a game designed to pick your brain and make you feel. 
[*]If you played the demo and loved it, stop reading here, you're gonna love the full game unless you're an anhedonic husk like me. [/list]
[b] Aesthetic[/b]
[list]
[*] Music averages out with a ""pretty damn good"" by my poor tastes. Some overworld themes were forgettable but overall I'd say there's enough tracks to listen to over and over again to justify buying the soundtrack, there's more than enough standout songs here to keep it from a one-hit-wonder, though maybe given the team credentials this is no surprise.
[*] Sound choice is cute, charming, for the most part nothing overstays its welcome.
[*] Visuals are clean, even in a world of oddities as these you won't have much trouble working out what you see at any time. Though a few overworld maps get a bit dull and repetitive where this game absolutely shines is character sprites. Few other places will you find such a fine middle ground between simplicity and expressiveness. [/list]
[b] Story and Gameplay [/b]
[list] 
[*] The main hook, a large feature of the game is that while you're free to savescum with your single file the game has a second, persistent ambiguous data cluster it saves and keeps track of behind your back. While the original demo touted this feature heavily it becomes a little played out now, especially since it's used commonly to little effect, making the times it does matter far less surprising. Sometimes this means skipping cutscenes in cleverly written ways, though, so you could say it balances as a bunch of neutrals and a few positives.
[*] It has an un-game feature of sorts where it loves to bait you into following old instincts based on patterns and tropes in other games then pulling the rug out from under you. It's clever. At first. If there comes to be a point when you just get burnt out on opening snake-filled peanut cans then even when the bait-and-switch is unexpected you'll be too far gone to care.
[*] You absolutely positively need to be invested in most to all of the recurring cast. You're gonna see a lot of these guys, and if you find some or another element of their personality annoying you're gonna have a bat time, mate. This might be a clever metaphor for something since I had to pretend to care about a handful of monsters who had me gritting my teeth at their every appearance if I wanted to get the good ending. For me, this was a rather large hangup as the game will depend largely at your attachment to the characters.
[*] Unless you're coming in almost 100% blind you'll be doing the most pacifist run you can. Unfortunately, this means just slightly less repetition than the violent route. Common enemies are almost always ""check actions menu, do the nice one, mercy next turn"" while bosses go ""do one or two simple actions and then just stall out for a dozen or so turns until the boss is done talking"".  This can be a little problem when the best parts of a boss battle are the music and imagining my Gandhi-Madotsuki-Jaundice-Baby ducking and weaving through flurries of blows.
[*] Offsetting the ""attacking"" (or lack thereof) being bland it certainly makes up for it in the ""defending"" portions. A sprinkle of Dragon Quest flavor and some bullet hell mixed with really unique and appealing patterns made for some interesting conflicts, though the thrill was dampened by common enemies being a nusciance to clear out as fast as possible or boss battles dragging on and having you weave minute variations of the same attack.
[*] For a game that should know how deadset you are on not killing, it really doesn't do you any favors. Too many things result in items and equipment you won't much need. In total I bought one anti-weapon, found better armor and slowly came to realize I had no more item management to do other than the rare event of spending my not-fighting-money on healing items. [/list]
[b] Overview [/b]
A lot of people are gonna tell you Undertale is perfect, charming, touching, and I just wanted to say that I love what these devs do, but this game is some of those things, none of the other things and subjectively other things. I don't think my hu-man shell has the capacity for cynicism to say that the kickstarter cash invesent and time taken didn't shell out nicely and fairly reflect Toby putting it to good use, but I also can't say that it's without flaws, flaws that might ruin an experience for you even if you came in wanting to play it and love it. What I can say is that it's the best kind of game for success. If you're already sold on it, you buy it. If you're unsure though, I can't say what kind of person would or wouldn't like it. I can only say you need to experience it yourself and I'll be damned if that isn't something special.

Maybe as a whole I didn't like the full version, but I hope, pray, I'll be the narrowest of minorities on that.
Undertale will give you a warm smile.
Undertale will give you flowers.

As someone who doesn't normally enjoy visual novels, I was hesitant at first. Sure, the setting and the anime aesthetic appealed to me, but there was a big chance that this game would be just another VN hyped up by its fanatic anime fans. But damn‚Ä¶ was I surprised by what I found! The game managed to change my mind pretty much instantly, not because of its art style or its soundtrack (though they are huge contributors towards that), but because of the overall feel and well presented aosphere.
 
As always, these are my own opinions and experiences, please consider reading other reviews too!
 
[h1][Negatives][/h1]
Just some minor things that i still want to mention just to spice things up.
 
While this game features a form of gameplay, and I‚Äôm very glad that it does; the mixing of drinks can be a bit repetitive at times. No wonder some people say that you should play it in sessions and take breaks, just like the protagonist. The problem is the fixed number of recipes at your disposal and the way the system works, you have the initial 24 drinks but that‚Äôs it really, no new ones will be introduced during your playthrough which is a missed opportunity. A double-click option would‚Äôve been nice to add the ingredients directly instead of dragging every single one of them. Checkpoints are often very far apart from each other which can result in frustration since you have to possibly play huge chunks of the game again, if you fu-ck up or want to do something differently.
 
[h1][Gameplay][/h1]
I‚Äôm truly glad to have the bartending as a way of interacting with the characters in the game, without this feature, the game wouldn‚Äôt be half as engaging as it is right now. Mixing drinks together is fun and thankfully doesn‚Äôt require a crazy tutorial or anything like that. Simply mix together the ingredients based on the recipes and you're done with the exceptions of big drinks and a few others. Manage Jill‚Äôs home between days to spent your hard-earned cash for silly stuff or save up to pay the rent. You even get tiny bits of lore in her smartphone and the ability to save/load, which can also be done during work-breaks.
 
What I think is the most important part is the need to satisfy the customers taste through mixing alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks together from scratch. You are often asked to guess the right drink for the right customer, luckily the game has a built-in list of 24 available recipes to help you with that. Some clients require you to be quick, remember their favourite drinks or even guess the right one that could trigger new events and story bits. This is the main way to influence the game's progression and the ending that you will get, so be sure to try something different then the game is telling you. Just pay attention to your customer and what they order, it might not always be what they really want or need! A character is depressed and orders something sweet? Add some alcohol to let him forget about their troubles thanks to optional recipes where you can add as much of it as you want.
 
[h1][Story][/h1]
VA-11 Hall-A‚Äôs story revolves around the everyday life of bartender Jill and her customers as well as her boss and co-worker Gillian and many others. A diverse cast of characters who are relatable, believable and interesting in one way or another and have their own problems and worries in life that you can be a part of. Even though you don't have any choices during the conversations itself, the discussions are still pretty engaging and well presented making you crave for more.
 
[h1][Graphics][/h1]
The visuals are reminiscent of old Japanese adventure games for the PC-98, the first visual novels one could say. Everything is more detailed though and gives this a very modern look and feel. Good looking characters also make sure that you are interested in finding out more about them and exactly why they chose your bar of all places.
 
[h1][Music][/h1]
Fitting, satisfying style of music fitting a cyberpunk city so incredibly well and don‚Äôt ask me why but some songs even reminded me of games of my childhood like Zone of the Enders, Final Fantasy VII, Breath of Fire III and countless others. The soundtrack is certainly one of the bigger contributors to VA-11 Hall-A‚Äôs success.
 
https://garoad.bandcamp.com/album/va-11-hall-a-second-round

VA-11 Hall-A is an incredible 10-20 hour adventure that is without a doubt one of the best Visual Novels currently available on Steam. This game is an amazing and mature experience and I‚Äôm glad that I finally got around to playing it, and do hope a sequel is in the works!
 
I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Visual Novels with lots of text. Fans of the cyberpunk will also find great value in this beautiful game.

379430,Kingdom Come: Deliverance,2/14/2018,False,"Quite a nice game, but unfortunately the developers totally neglected a gamer's real life.
There is no way to save apart from either going to sleep (at the end of the day) or using a you-cannot-afford-it item. This includes the missing option to ""save and quit"" so that maybe you could continue where you left off a day later. No, nada. Complete the game-day or perish. If you don't have the time to play four hours right now: bad luck, better refrain from even attempting this game.
Furthermore, there's cutscenes. Lots of them. Without a pause-button. So, if you get a call during a 15 minutes cutscene, either miss the story or miss the call.
If you have something you consider a life, definitely don't waste money on this.

242920,Banished,2/20/2014,False,"I really love this game, the whole experience was very enjoyable while playing, and it actually proved to be quite a challenge, however....... I've played for 10 hours and I've basically seen everything this game has to offer, I've maintained a population of around 190 people, built all the buildings in the game, expanded a far distance across a large map, and kept my whole population 4.5/5 happy and healthy for the entire duration of my playtime, the only thing left me to do is just build more houses.... in turn building more food->wood->woodcutter infrastructures to help maintain this. 

While I really enjoyed this game, the graphics, the design, the art, the mechanics, the game is extremely short and lacking in more... I don't know stuff. I know that it is only a 1 man team, and for that He's done something amazing. I just can't help but feel this game could be one of the best city-building games out there, if there were more things to do, maybe an advancement in technology (not like, pewpew-lazers), or perhaps the option to build larger houses, or more entertainment facilities, or just more buildings in general. Basically the game turned into the same, repeat infrastructure too fast and to soon in, where-as similiar games had a lot more longevity to them, such as Anno 2070 just to put as an example.

In closing, I would say this game was really fun to play, I am just saddened that it has nothing left to offer me after only 10 hours of play, I really want to play more, but there is literally nothing to do, just build more wood gatherers, and more food... and then more woodcutters to supply the demand, thats it........ It's too easy to keep your people happy/healthy and in turn disaters came few and far between, and once you get into the big population numbers random deaths don't have any impact when your playing around with a standing work force of 15-20 larbourers at any given time.

543900,METAL GEAR SURVIVE,2/22/2018,False,"This review will be about the game, and Ill avoid discussing any related politics or controversies.

The central plot of MG Survive is absolutely ridiculous. After the Mother Base attack (end of MGS ground zero) some wormhole portal opened into another dimension. When that happened... Actually I dont know. The entire story is a mess, despite the monotonous amount of exposition the game drones on about in its opening hour. Theres quite a lot going on, all at once, and it isnt written well so there are plot holes galore. As IGN diligently pointed out, Mother Base from MGSV didnt even exist at that point, it wasnt until an entire decade later in the universes timeline that it was built. That one went right over the heads of Konamis writers apparently.

The zombies are a source of energy, called Kuban energy. Yes thats right, zombies can be harvested for an energy that can fuel many things. This can eventually replace fuels like gasoline to power vehicles and machines. Cringe worthy... Who the hell even thinks of this drivel?

The script is very hokey, and also poorly written. Voice acting is uninspired and emotionally wooden. The cast of charcters are all forgettable and wholey uninteresting. Im only about 7 hours in, but so far everything has been very mediocre,  despite quite a lot being put into its opening segment.

The gameplay is clunky and lacks fluidity. Combat is rather dull due to the generic zombie enemies, which have absolutely broken AI. They are not challenging at all, are stupidly predictable. I guess thats to be expected from zombies, but the execution is poor. Sometimes they wont even notice you despite being right in front of them, even attacking them. The lack of enemy types is also a drag. Youll almost always be going against ""wanderers"" the generic zombie type, and since they are boring as heck to fight, combat is NOT a highlight of survive.

There are a few different weapon types, all of which are bland. There are one handed weapons like crowbars/machetes, two handed spears and bats, and projectile weapons. The melee weapons feel weak and are annoying to use. Poor hitboxes and long windup animations turn simple things into annoyances, hunting sheep for food turns into whack a mole as you struggle to chase it, attack, wait for the long windup, only for it to run just out of reach. There are no combos, attack strings last TWO hits, which makes the combat even more  bland.

Clearly Konami recycled the entire MGSV gameplay/graphics engine for Survive. This is noticeable in EVERY facet of the game. Recycled character models, menus, textures, weapons, animations, wildlife, sound effects... Everything, even down to the most minute and petty things like the loading icon or foliage and rock models. Its essentially an overhaul mod of MGSV. The world map is Afghanistan but with the terrain shuffled and sandstorms 24/7. But piggybacking on the accomplishments of MGSV should have worked, since it was such an incredible game. Using it as a foundation, this should have been pretty decent, but its not.

Edit: Ok so Ive found two different areas that are suspiciously similar to areas in MGSV, I mean like identical. A mission where your to use a wormhole digger to mine something called Iris... The buildings in the area are straight copy paste from the MGSV outpost where you have to kill/capture a spetnaz officer, one of the early game missions. Its literally the exact same buildings, same layout and even some furniture in the SAME areas like the bar in the back of the room and the couch next to it. I found another area near there that was the outpost from MGSV mission angel with broken wings where you rescue Malak. The big building where he is being held when the mission first starts, is once again a complete copy paste into Survive.

Edit: Ive noticed slowly that the entire world map, is Afghanistan from MGSV. I dont mean its like it, I  mean it IS is. The entire terrain map is identical, only differences is the placement of additional buildings. Its incredible, now I see why they added the ""dust"" which obscures your view. Without the 24/7 sandstorm youd be able to notice instantly its the same map.

Also into the story you rescue a black child.. ITS THE SAME EXACT KID FROM MGSV! They not only reused the body model, but even the face model, they didnt even alter any facial characteristics to hide this. Its the same damn kid. It really is mind blowing, seeing the extent to which they copy pasted, its unprecedented. The saddest part is despite Konami having all the tools, assets, and engine of an amazing game to build off of, they still cant make something worth a damn

Gun play is even worse than melee. The aiming and weapons in general are inept and clunky. This is very peculiar considering how much they reused from the previous MG game, youd think they would have stuck to what worked in it, but they did not. 

Theres a level up/progression system which is a great addition. It gives more meaning and purpose to playing. But sadly the actual progression of levelling up is mired by boring perks and abilities. Most of them are useful, like being able to finish off a zombie on the ground by stomping it.  But those are all zombie game cliches, none are interesting or change the gameplay in meaningful ways.

There is also a building system you can use, to place things like fences or sandbag towers, while your out exploring. Its kind of cool to be able to place a fence in a choke point to hold off a mob of zombies, and poke them through the holes walking dead style. There are teleport/fast travel points you can capture in the world to make travelling easier, and when activating them for the first time, they require you to hold the point against zombies. This is one of the moments that makes the game fun, as you get to strategically place objects and hold out against a small horde until the countdown stops. Sadly these events are few and far between, and short lived.

Between the fun moments there is a quagmire of tedious grinding, bland gameplay, and lack of purpose. Exploration is always interrupted by the incessant need for micromanagement, of hunger thirst and oxygen level if your in certain areas. Food and water are extremely scarce and those needs control everything in the game.

Your character is a total hog, you need to kill and eat FOUR SHEEP just to fill your hunger meter, and drink four to five HUGE jugs of water. Its excessive, way too demanding since these resources are so scarce. I found myself interrupted time and time again from exploring because I had to fix my insatiable appetite. Its overly intrusive and a big downer.

Water is the hardest to come by. Dont get me wrong, your surrounded by springs and ponds, and will find tons of bottles to fill it with. But it will be considered ""dirty"" and drinking it will cause illness, which is basically an irritating mechanic of making you stop every 5 seconds for a 3 second long vomit animation. Even more of a nuisance is that they decided to lock the ability to boil water until you progress 5-7 hours into the story.

 Its an absurd design choice. You need SO much water constantly, and Ive only found 4 bottles of clean water the entire time ive been playing. For the last few hours in game Ive been forced to drink dirty water to avoid death, so Ive been dealing with nonstop vomit interruptions. Its beyond infuriating. Its a survival game I know, but the way these aspects are implemented is poor.

Microtransactions are not as bad as I was led to believe. There are no advertisements, no enticements or bait. I cant remember a single time the game has even mentioned them. The only reason Im even aware of their existence is from news articles. They can be found in the start menu, and there really isnt much there in the way of offerings. I only saw one thing, some kind of subscription to get a boost to resources gained, or something like that. This game surprisingly handles microtransactions well.

Perhaps I didn't care that much
You were the best of friends

Around you anymore

I hope you understand
I shall visit you again
When universes collide
And all that left is to die

377160,Fallout 4,11/11/2015,False,"[h1] Disappointed [/h1]
People are giving this positive reviews because it's not broken like AC:Unity/Arkham Knight. Is this the standard we now accept? As long as the game can start and run at a decent FPS we're happy? Don't we care about the contents of the actual game? I genuinely wanted this game to be good. But it just isn't. I expected an open world RPG with all that entails, but I got an open world shooter with subpar shooter mechanics and crappy colliders. It seems like Bethesda lacked direction, focus and priorities. More on that as we go.

FYI: I've only played on Survival difficulty (the hardest there is), and all of my gameplay related experiences is reflected in that.

[h1] AI: [/h1]
The AI is really unintelligent and just flat out boring to fight. There is barely, if any, difference in how humans and dogs act in combat. Neither tries to alarm their pack/friends if attacked and both just charges dumbly towards you. Even if I put down all of their friends without a single scratch, they still don't care. Doesn't matter that they are hopelessly ouatched either. They're just sheep to the slaughter. And you might say: ""Well, that's just like all of their other previous titles, isn't it?"" And yes, pretty much. It seems like they haven't bothered developing new AI since they released TES IV: Oblivion. Which is just really sad.

[h1] Collision: [/h1]
Really inconsistent colliders. Sometimes they are just fine, other times the devs just put an oversized box collider over a pipe. I can clearly see the entire head, and most of the body, of my target, but when I shoot at him the bullet hits the big invisible box around the pipe. However, these same colliders don't block vision for the AI or your characters movement (most of the time), just bullets. The game also includes lots of obstacles that are just 1-3 centimeters too low for your character to move below, even though there is clearly enough space if only your character had a shorter haircut. Other times there is definitely enough space, but instead you are simply blocked by invisible colliders in thin air due to a massive single box collider being placed over an 'X' of two crossing support beams. Crappy colliders combined with sacks of HP controlled by crappy AI makes combat a really dull and boring affair.

[h1] UI Design: [/h1]
And the UI design is, to put it bluntly, a god damn awful mess. It looks like something that was made during their internal alpha and then subsequently forgotten about. I don't think there is a single good thing I can say regarding the UI. The game is riddled with both small and big UI nuisances, some of which are quite gamebreaking. Yes. The UI is gamebreaking! And it's not even a bug, it's a design choice! Here's the worst of them from the top of my head:

[list]
[*] The UI is horrendous to navigate. It's like a minigame in and of itself. It requires two hands on the keyboard and one on the mouse to navigate it smoothly. The ""favorites"" menu is especially bad as it doesn't pause the game when in use. It is also clearly imported directly from the console version and is clearly not optimized for PC users. Just switching between my 4 most used weapons and a few throwables/consumables is a major hassle. And about 50% of the time my weapon disappears for several seconds after I switch using the favorites menu, often ending my character's life.

[*] Whenever you get on low health or get a crippled limb the game pauses and a pop up appears that tells you that you need to use a Stimpak. This often happens while someone is shooting at you. So now you have to go press ""OK"" in the middle of a firefight, and as the game resumes there is a very brief moment where the game doesn't properly record your inputs, which means you often die before you can do anything. This often happens even though you could easily have won if the popup hadn't been there. 95% of all my deaths are because of this. This forces me to constantly quicksave to avoid losing progress. Add this to the loading time and I probably spend more time in loading screens that actual combat.

[*] The building UI (if you can even call that monstrosity a UI) is basically non-existent and extremely bad. It looks like a feature they just added in the very last moment because why not? Except, using this sytem is a big part of the game.
[/list]

[h1] Build Mode: [/h1]
Building in build mode doesn't even feel like building. It's more like using a badly developed creative mode. You instantly remove/build everything. But you do this while struggling against the controls. It's like another minigame, and it's arguably worse than the UI. It feels like a bad mobile game ported to PC. At least it's not freemium, but that's is about the only upside that comes to mind. They make this awful system a part of the main story, but they don't bother to polish it and make it fun to use. This reflects very poorly on the main story. They shouldn't even have begun development on this feature until all other game essential features have been completed. It's called prioritizing, something they clearly haven't done at all.

[h1] Characters: [/h1]
The characters are uninteresting, one-sided, characterless robots. The most characteristic character I've met so far IS a robot; your butler before the apocalypse, Codsworth. And he's not even that interesting. Literally the most interesting thing about him is the fact that he can pronounce many, many different character names. But why did they even waste their time developing this feature when there were so many other features that clearly aren't done yet? Like for example their MAIN STORYLINE and the characters that is taking part in it? Lack of priorities.

[h1] Story: [/h1]
So far the story pacing has been really bad. The story started out with a great premise, but then the story just went and died in a corner. Within the first hour of the game (still in prologue) something really important happens to your character ([spoiler] Your son was kidnapped [/spoiler]). Since then all I've been doing is generic ""Go to A, shoot/get stuff"" for 10+ hours. It's as if it never happened, except for a few brief moments where you just casually comment on that really important thing - I've heard people speak about the weather with more affection. But I guess this is how it had to be due to how the dialogue options was designed:

[h1] Dialogue: [/h1]
The dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen in a roleplaying game. I've seen dating sims with better written dialogue AND more dialogue options. Fallout 4 decided to go for the ""always and only 4 generic dialogue options, all explained in only one word"". Those words are usually always the same: Yes, No, Sarcasm, and a question about something (Info). You don't know what exactly you're going to say, and especially Sarcasm is bad here. You might insult them or just make a joke. Again: they bothered to develop a very crappy and non-essential feature like the building mechanic before polishing and quality testing their dialogue. Lack of priorities.

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
All in all I must say that Fallout 4 has been a massive disappoinent. The fun only lasts while your still hyped and capable of ignoring all its flaws, which sadly won't be for long as they keep intruding on the rest of your gameplay. 4/10 for good graphics, just barely acceptable gameplay, and hype fuel.

[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]
The game suffers from a complete lack of priorities during development which is clearly seen in pretty much every single part of the game. Controls and UI are clearly imported from consoles; the controls are somewhat acceptable in spite of this, but the UI is a complete and utter disaster that features gamebreaking design choices. Yes, design choices, not bugs, manages to break the game on higher difficulties. Story is just meh, and dialogue is just as bad or worse than the UI. If you're looking for a roleplaying game, then go somewhere else.",51016,1913,76561198002573000,8,15.97 hrs

Followed by the realization that this has no business being called a Metal Gear game.

This is ill-conceived on every possible level. A soldier from Mother base gets transported to a nether realm version of earth where he must eat and drink every 10 minutes or he dies. At the behest of Launce Fishburne, he must stab zombies for their sweet nectar which is used as money by robots for some reason. He then must go around nether earth turning on machines which will summon zombies which he must stab with a pipe because those zombies will destroy the machine. And don't forget to eat because you'll die if you don't! That's the entire game.

546560,Half-Life: Alyx,3/26/2020,True,"I can barely form words after the ending of this game. I will never spoil it for people who have not gotten there yet, so I wont go further into it.
This game is a literal masterpiece. From the visuals, to the music, to the story that leaves you questioning everything, Valve has managed to create a VR title set in the Half-Life universe, that rivals all other Half-Life titles. 

Valve, Half-Life and their other titles saved me from a very dark time 13 years ago. And every Valve title that comes out I give my full attention. This game brought back the feelings of mystery, wonder, and concern on how my favorite characters were going to end up. Even with the knowledge of future events, as this is a prequel, it left you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The story was brilliantly written, and no one could have for seen where it was going. A pivotal roll in Half-Life's overall story and a must play for any fan of the franchise. 

The graphics were absolutely stunning, and the Source Engine has been changed for the better. Comparing Source with Source 2 is like Source Gold with Source. Stunning difference! Physics are still wonky from time to time, but this made me appreciate it even more. Just like old times!

Valve seems to already be on top of patches, so I'll leave the little bugs alone as they have been updating it pretty often over the last few days.
I have some issues with how it functions for lower end headsets, like the Samsung Plus, as grenade throwing can be a bit wonky with the controllers going outside the camera's zone. But I don't really think this Valve related per-say, though the amount of times you need to USE grenades could be a bit lower. But all in all, for a lower end Windows headset like mine, I don't have many grips. Controls worked flawlessly and all responded correctly. I used continuous motion but I did find myself using the Teleport to get to places quicker. So a nice medium mix between the two was my sweet spot. Lots of options to mess around with, especially if you get motion sick.

I must point out the VAST amount of options you have available. Valve thought of a lot of people with this title to appeal to as many as they could. From Colorblind options to Light Sensitivity for people who suffer from Epilepsy. You can even play with one hand. Teleport, Smooth Motion, and Hybrids are BOTH options. So people who like either one, or both, can use what they are comfortable with. Valve just added Smooth Turning and they also have snap turning if it makes you motion sick. Play around with it, you'll find your sweet spot.

All in all, for any Half-Life and Valve fan, this is a MUST! If you don't have a VR to play it, go grab a cheaper one and experience it for yourself. You DON'T NEED an Index to play this game! If you're sure VR is not your thing, go watch a play through on YouTube and support Valve to keep encouraging them to make more games like Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. They seem to have their spark back, and by the gods the STILL have what it takes to make masterpiece games.

This final message, though I know they will never see it, is a Thank you to Valve. Thank you for making this game. Thank you for taking me back to a time where I discovered this series. And thank you for continuing to influence my life with all the things you have done for us! Please keep making games, and Thank you so much!",26233,1415,76561198019078900,5,15.63 hrs

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,5/25/2016,True,"As a kid I used to paint and collect Warhammer. I would imagine my warriors battle hoardes of Orcs and Chaos as I played against my brother and my friends. Great heroes and huge, sprawling battles raged in my mind. My brother's Empire troops standing bravely against my vampire hoarde!

The only place I could actually see something akin to these battles was through the Total War franchise with Rome Total War which we also used to play together. Ambushing his Roman column with Gaulic warriors!

I have waited twelve years for this pairing to come along. Even since I heard the announcements I have been eagerly waiting. Despite all of that pressure, the game did not disappoint. The battles that I dreamed of seeing as a kid are coming to life before my eyes. 

I now live in the USA and my brother is still in England.  We are playing our cooperative campaign to recreate those same rivalries, stories and memories that we would make with our models on our kitchen table as kids. Technology like this makes life better.

219740,Don't Starve,11/30/2013,False,"Don't Starve is an indie game in the somewhat crowded genre of ""survive a hostile environment by crafting"". I bought it just as it went out of beta, drawn mostly by the TimBurtonesque graphics.

I feel I gave Don't Starve a fair chance, investing 13 hours into it, although the prospect of abandoning it felt tantalizing after just 5. I have to be honest: 13 hours is far from enough to experience the most sophisticated tiers of crafting. It‚Äôs unfortunately more than enough to resent the experience and I‚Äôll soon get to the reasons for that.

But first, the positive. The initial impressions are excellent. The graphics are intriguing and can best be described as what a children‚Äôs pop-up book could look like if it was designed by Tim Burton. Almost all of the game's elements (animals, plants, ‚Ä¶) are delightful and original. The only flaw in the graphics concerns some of the ground‚Äôs textures, which are slightly pixelated, at least on Full HD resolution. Music is rather sparse, but the sound effects are realistically bucolic and I loved the idea that when your character ‚Äútalks‚Äù (in reaction to one of your commands), he/she does so with the sound of an orchestral instrument (luckily, with English subtitles)

The first couple of hours with the game are great. You feel very free exploring your environment, and yet captive of the timing: night comes all too soon! At the very minimum, on your first day, you need to collect a couple of food items (even as weak as berries and carrots) and get enough material to make a fire, which itself requires an axe (that you also must craft on the first day). The next day, you must to learn to balance three vital gauges: heath, satiety and sanity. Should any of them reach 0, you‚Äôre history. Speaking of which, let me introduce you to your new nemesis‚Ä¶


PERMADEATH! If you've played roguelikes in the past, you two have already met. If not, let me explain. Permadeath means that when you die, there is no pressing a load button and re-starting from a safe point from the past. The game allows you to save your progress, but only when you quit, so that you don‚Äôt have to play a full game in one session. But should you cross path with the Grim Reaper, Don't Starve will mercilessly and meticulously destroy any save file that might inhabit your hard drive, forcing you to go back to the very beginning each and every time you die. In many games, this is not problematic. Many roguelikes are fun to start again over and over, because their random world generation often comes up with a unique situation and/or because you can try a completely different strategy, maybe by creating a character of a different class.

The problem with Permadeath in Don't Starve is that there aren't many different strategies in the beginning. Sure, after some in-game days, you can specialise your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it‚Äôs not fun any more after a point, and you‚Äôll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons. The point of a crafting/surviving game like this, especially one where you have to figure out most everything by yourself, is to experiment, to try crazy things and hope for a reward. But here, with no way of knowing in advance if a new enemy is fair game or completely badass, experimenting often means dying, and being punished by re-playing the same boring first days.

You‚Äôd be forgiven to think that Don't Starve's unlockable characters alleviate the above-mentioned problem. But you‚Äôd be wrong: they mostly add a bit of flavour to the game, but don‚Äôt offer any real potential for strategic diversification. 

As if repetitiveness wasn't enough, the world generation algorithm hates you. The algorithm basically creates a huge map made of different ‚Äúbiomes‚Äù (forests, plains, swamps‚Ä¶). A biome has a specific population of animals, plants and other resources. Some of those resources are really basic building blocks for crafting, yet the algorithm sometimes takes great pride in placing the biomes that host them very far from you. You therefore often have no other solution than to spend several in-game days running around without crafting anything useful, just because there is no gold or even plain rocks, anywhere near your starting position. Judging from my experience, it's not a rare occurrence. There are some interesting special features disseminated across the map, but they‚Äôre spread fairly thin. In the end, it's hard to understand why such a huge map was needed in the first place.

The last major complain I have is perhaps partly inherent to the genre and therefore not entirely the game‚Äôs fault: an almost complete lack of information. I already explained how not knowing anything about an enemy could mean death by experimentation. But it‚Äôs the same for almost each of the game‚Äôs features. The crafting recipes are mostly public, but the uses and strengths of the crafted objects are not. So, I've crafted a helm or an armour: Just what difference does it make? Beats me. So, I see my sanity declining dangerously. Why? What can I do to improve the situation? The game never tells, leaving the player to try things and not always finding a satisfactory answer. There is a fan-made wiki that you can consult if you‚Äôre curious about this or that aspect. But it's still very difficult to find just the information you need without having other secrets spoiled for you at the same time. I really wish the game would give you clues, even infrequent and vague ones. At the very least, I expected the game to explain the controls, how to move my character or rotate the view. Turned out, I needed to visit the official forum for that too!

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with Don't Starve. I find it hard to recommend to anyone, save maybe the most patients among you who don‚Äôt find repetitive grinding objectionable. It‚Äôs a shame really, because for the purpose of this review, I read a significant part of the Wiki, and there are some really neat ideas. But more of them should have been used to diversify the starting strategy and they also need to be spread less thin across the map.",58101,1074,76561197977748900,35,15.40 hrs

391540,Undertale,11/10/2015,True,"Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.

But... wow. Undertale blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.

I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr [strike](god help us)[/strike] and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.

Of course, I call Undertale an ""experience"", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it. Following the motto on the store page, ""the game where you don't have to destroy anyone"", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to ""Spare them!"". And of course, you answer with ""Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? What's in it for me?"" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point. And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here.

Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.

On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're [i]too cool[/i] or [i]grown up[/i] to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of ""Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes""... the weight of a dark choice is huge. Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... [u]It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.[/u]

It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.

Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.

It is a sin to call Undertale a game. Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free ""kill-em-all"" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.

- It totally lacks the faction based opinions and world contruction previous games like Fallout New Vegas had, here in Fallout 4 it's basically ""good guys vs. bad guys""
- The RPG system of previous fallout games was simplified to the point of becoming non-existent: you can use every weapon from the start, most dialogue option lead to the same results, your character is voiced and will sound always like a white middle class Murican, which ruins char creation process and roleplay; the story is ripped from Fallout 3... complete washed up crap, I got really angry when I saw all dat schit!

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,9/8/2013,True,"A Review of Rome 2.

So. Yesterday I finally decided, after crushing another army at shogun 2, to give Rome 2 a whirl.
I'll mostly compare it to Shogun 2, seeing as CA&SEGA tried to surpass it's success.
Now, I know about how hyped it was, and how much flak it's been getting since release, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.

Gameplay-wise, combat.
Good points:
All factions have different units, with slightly different statistics to boot, which makes for more varied combat situations.
Statistics are now broken down in even more sections that can be improved upon.
Units are thankfully still in 100+ range, so your 20 unit army is still large enough.
Hiding has been slightly improved upon shogun 2, and LoS hiding is detailed a bit better.
Garrisons are now meaningful enough that one unit of bowmen can no longer snipe down an entire city.

Bad points.
Morale. I don't know what they're thinking down there, but early units' morale is so ridiculously low that getting twenty casualties can send units into a shattered state.
Differences in unit strength. Your basic units are so weak when people start fielding their mainstays that, coupled with that horrendous morale issue, they hold for a literal ten seconds before routing.
Your land army can spontaneously and instantly turn into a fullstack navy on a whim, making real navies pretty much pointless.
Defensive battles are made even easier by making any and all defenders able to rout, and having 0 morale bonus for being the last line of defense, which makes sieges a cakewalk.


Diplomacy
Good points:
New requests: Non-aggression pacts, defensive alliances, military alliances, yes! Give diplomacy a function besides extorting money and asking for trade agreements. 
The AI actively pursues diplomacy now, very rewarding.

Bad points:
The AI actively pursues diplomacy, like a toddler. Geography, war/peace status and relationships matter not to the AI, additionally they ask for the most ridiculous prices for mundane things at time, or ask senseless requests every single turn.
Diplomatic relations are confusing and often nonsensical, even though there are way more actions that affect relations now.

Gameplay-wise AI

Good:
AI now partakes in many more activities than before, and combines their land and naval armies in assaults now.

Bad:
Pretty much everything.
AI in field battles goes in a near-straight line for your units, tries to send cavalry to a flank and then forgets about it, and battles devolve into a slugfest until they're out of units.
AI on an offensive siege battles rushes your control points(REALLY NOW?) instantly, and that's it.
AI on defensive siege battles...Stand their ground, even if they have no missile units and you're standing there slinging projectiles on their poor militia until the last arrow has been spent.
AI sometimes inexplicably moves their army to who-knows-where when you're standing five feet from their capital, and leaves it wide-open for a quick siege.
AI occasionally does seemingly senseless attacks with one or two units against a city or fullstack, and then obviously loses.


Other things of note:
You cannot, I repeat, CANNOT recruit any units anywhere, anywhen, except for straight into a general's army. So don't bother trying.
Generals are near-pointless except for getting an easy elite unit.
Expect graphical glitches and FPS drops, even on super-tier computers.
Although there are several different factions, you are still very limited in your choices, which is a disappoinent personally.




Conclusion:
Is this the TW game to rule all TW games? No.
Is this game worth buying? If you're a TW type of game fan, pick it up for a campaign or two, though I recommend waiting for either fixes or it going on sale.
Is it worth buying when you're new to the genre? No. If you wish to experience all that TW has to offer, Shogun 2 or perhaps medieval TW are the ways to go.

Total score:
6.5/10
If you like the series, grab it if only for completionist's sake, if you are new to it or still in doubt, wait for fixes or it going on sale.

The game is Skyrim. The graphics have definitely been improved from the original game. I've had no problems so far and it's running smoothly on preset Ultra @ 60 fps on my MSI 970. 

You get the original game, with a nice looking, subtle ENB-esque colour scheme with updated textures. It looks nice to say the least.

The game was free. You get to play all the DLC. It's another reason to play through Skyrim again. Why are you complaining?

P.S. To all of the people commenting ""it wasn't free"". You had from E3 this year to purchase the original Skyrim and all of the DLC for under ¬£10 in multiple Steam sales. And you have the audacity to call me the stupid one?

P.P.S. I'm not bragging about my hours in CSGO. I'm simply stating that people complaining about this game are worse than the people who play CSGO. Including myself.

P.P.P.S. ""Mods make original Skyrim better."" Mods will make this one better too. I'm talking about the BASE game compared to the original Skyrim BASE game. Not with mods. You don't review a game because of mods.

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

In Nether you can find an assorent of things to do such as: Getting killed by a monster! Starving to death! Blowing your brains out over your keyboard!

Welcome to Nether, where our slogan is, if you see it, shoot it! We'll get you hyped up over Co-op and helping eachother out, while showing you that you can be betrayed at anytime. But fuck that shit! If you loved getting tied up and force fed a rotting banana in DayZ, you'll love mercilessly getting shot every time you spawn in Nether! Don't want to get shot? We introdue a brand new feature of spawning in a safezone! But guess what, fuck you because it will be breached by Nether and will infact be a terrible place to spawn!

You'll be thrilled when you finally lose your shit and join in the murder frenzy! Kill on sight and loot corpses then discover that you've paid $15+ for the biggest game of Call of Duty ever made! Minus the assorent of guns and perks you're prety much just trying to kill other humans. 

But wait, there's more! The totally no existent story will leave you in tears begging for more, and the newly added tribes will make you wish you had just spent the extra $15 for pretty much any other fucking game! 

Did we mention all of the special features? Boss battles that totally suck, nether surges, which you'll just avoid because fuck that, and cosmetic items! 

Last but not least, the player base! All 300+ of our regular players will swear up and down that Nether is the greatest game ever and there is nothing more fun than sitting outside of a safezone and sniping new players. Because who wants their favorite game to be successful? Not our playerbase, that's for sure!

So if you're a homicidal maniac who sucks at Call of Duty and feels the need to kill people in an indirect fashion; then this games for you! And if you're on the fence about giving it a try, here's some words of advice: Don't waste your fucking money.

After several times telling me to fuck off because I am not part of cancer group they banned me from the forums.

It's like they tried making the game look shiny and put it on steam to make people buy it (Oh cool, it looks like Stalker and DayZ) and as soon as they have got enough money they are going to make Garrysmod 2.0 out of it (""We don't know where we go with this product yet..."")


It's an absolute impertinence that this game is even on steam.

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't condone racial slurs. That's not my beef with this move.

The problem is that whenever you have extreme-stance draconic policies like this, elsewise ban-hammer, you set a precedent that becomes a slippery slope.

There really isn't a set ""standard"" for what hate speech is. Yes, there are definitions you can look up online, but there's no sensible method of application of such a thing when you put it into practice.

1. Anything that can ""offend"" someone can be considered hate speech.
2. Anyone can decide to ""claim"" to be offended as a way of trolling or of retaliating against someone.

I've heard people say ""you can't goad someone into being a bad person, so they deserve the ban...""

Yet I've heard of this one unfortunate kid that got tricked by this little play by a troll...

""Hey, I'm doing a crossword can you help me? It's a 5 letter word that fits the phrase '_____ and span?'""

http://www.dictionary.com/browse/spick--and--span

A ban occurred, because the word that fits that blank is also used as a derogatory term for latin americans. Does that seem reasonable?

In an effort to try and quell toxicity and hostility in the online environment, the devs have actually CREATED a toxic and hostile environment where people now must be paranoid about what they say while in the game. People have started to go silent in games in order to avoid accidentally saying spur of the moment idles (which is extremely common in lightning-round fps games).

This is draconian. Again, I don't condone racial slurs, but I'd rather deal with powerless people who were rude, than powerFUL people who were toxic in their well meaning gestures that actually cause suffering and damage to the market as a whole.

275850,No Man's Sky,8/15/2016,False,"So I never knew space was so boring.

No man's Sky is a great idea that just never lived up to the hype. For the record I have had none of the technical issues that most players have had, and have around 10 hours on the game at writing this. 

The problem of the game is simply this. There is nothing epic in this game. No real reason to travel to the center of the universe, except to maybe see a cut scene or something similar hopefully making the game worth it. 

Once you have had an hour in the game, mined some stuff, catalogged some animals, done some repairs to your ship, and flown into space, that is pretty much it. Gameplay is repetative and more then a little grindy. Everytime you take off your ship burns 25% of its total fuel. You fly usally less then 30 seconds, land near an unexplored point, (which are bland and unmemorable), click on the point, record that you found it, rinse, repeat. Then since the game is so much fun you need to tediously mine low grade minerals to fuel your ship, power your laser, and keep life support running. Which you need to keep doing because you consume a lot of resources. Then when you mine too much you get attacked by the sentinel fuckbots, because, you know, mining is so much fun they need to make the game more annoying.

There is a simple crafting system in the game that has done nothing to grab my attention. The ships are exactly alike in every way except the way they look and how much storage they have. If you didn't mind grinding constantly to keep supplied and liked the look of the first ship in game, there is literally no reason to upgrade otherwise. They manuever the same, they accelerate the same, they feel the same, just look a little different. Same with your multitool. All of them are exactly the same, except look, and storage.

Lastly there are the alien races in the game. The ones that always stand in the same spots in their drab little settlements on every planet you visit are boring and have no real AI. The best part about them is that you can't understand them at all until you fly around to even more points, to go to ancient ruins and the such, to attempt to learn their language. One single word at a time. That's right kiddies, at 10 hours in, I have compiled somewhere around 50 words and still have no F'ing clue what they are talking about. Usually around the aliens are mathmatical puzzles to unlock items or to highlight yet another place for you to go to, which is fun right? No. These puzzles are usually noticing a pattern in numbers and could be solved easily by the average 2nd grader. Also where are the Alien cities or the like? The only thing that aliens do in this game is make you feel a little more insignificant, because actually you aren't discovering anything. You are just renaming stuff they apparently already found and are sitting on. Aliens on every world. That isn't exploring, its sightseeing.

Sadly I guess I am just bitter. I really, really wanted to like this game. I wanted the feeling of epic adventure that we all dream would accompany exploration and space travel. The game just doesn't deliver. I will keep playing the game for a bit just to see if there is anything else waiting for me over the next dune, so to speak, but I am not confident anything will be over that horizon.

Lastly, WTF is up with all the pastel colors. They don't have real greens, etc. in space?

Epic idea, poorly executed, and not worth a price tag of $60. This is why I never preorder a game.

I loaded up a game Steam sold
The trucking sim of much acclaim
While thinking, ‚Äúwhat a stupid game.‚Äù

At first I tried to play my way
By squishing peds and bringing pain
‚ÄúWhere are the cops?‚Äù I asked myself
Trying to earn my place in Hell.

But time went on I grew bored
I'd do one run and then ignore
This game that they‚Äôd called 'Comfy Truck'
And then move on without a-

BUT WAIT! I'm almost out of time!
Just have some faith, I'll cross that line!
But time was past and pay was docked
My world was shattered, faith was rocked.

‚ÄúWell just one more.‚Äù I grumbled low
I loaded up and hit the road
""I've got it now."" as off I went
Soon to delete local content.

Passed peaceful pastures in the night
I saw a sunrise blinding bright
I guess this game's not all that bad
Though not the best I've ever had.

Pop playing on the radio
In harmony with my Volvo
This siren sought to bring me sleep
While consciousness I fought to keep.

I showed up, docked and dropped my charge
At a nondescriptive harbor yard
‚ÄúJust one more time,‚Äù said my girlfriend
‚ÄúTomorrow you can play again.‚Äù

But no, I knew I couldn't stop
The needs of commerce never drop
If it be chemicals or steel
I had to keep turning those wheels.

So down the road I charged once more
Through France, Poland and Luxembourg
And soon a thought occurred to me
Could this be what they call ‚Äòcomfy‚Äô?

If slow and peaceful is your aim
You'll not do better than this game
Now just real quick here's a rundown
So you‚Äôre running when you hit the ground.

You move cargo from A to B
I'd recommend quite hastily
If you do well and earn your pay
Then manage other drivers days.

And so with that ends my review

I hate turn-based RPGs. This is my Game of the Year. What.

After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good.

This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include. Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever. I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through. You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't. There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming. And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters. Great puzzles too, imo! 

It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise: 
-There's no grinding (unless you want to)
-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me
-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them!)
-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the ""Chosen One"" or whatever
-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers... 
-No backtracking (unless you want to! Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such.)
-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is...
-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than ""Evil is Bad, Good is Good."" Everyone has relateable motivations.
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs. It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions.
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously.

I could gush about it forever. Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life. It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat. It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing!!",26400,1554,76561198027365600,7,13.35 hrs

377160,Fallout 4,11/14/2015,False,"First, allow me to say - while this isn't a terrible game but I must also very quickly say that it is not a good game either. Fans of this series waited 5 years for this game to come out since Fallout New Vegas and the expectations were high and while it's reasonable to say that all these expectations could not have been met, I cannot help but be fully disappointed with the state they shipped this game out. 

Let's get it over with: there are so many things wrong with this game so let's go over them. 

The AI is atrocious. It hasn't improved even a little bit since Fallout 3, back in 2008. Zero improvements in the AI in 7 years. Enemies will ignore cover, they will run at you (and sometimes past you) and they will spam unlimited grenades at you that WILL land on your head every single time. Just like before, if you snipe enemies from a long enough distance, they run around in a circles as until they die or until they luck out and magically manage to discover the direction you're shooting from. Your own followers are terrible in combat and will often not be able to hit a single thing they're shooting at and die rather quickly. There's virtually no reason to use anyone other than the dog, simply because at least the dog can haul down enemies and insta-kill low health enemies for you among his other abilities... like breaking through master locks to hand you items inside them. 

The plot is awful. No, it's straight up awful. It's the exact same plot as Fallout 3 except this time you're the dad looking for the son. You're given power armor and a minigun in the first 15 minutes of gameplay by people who have no reason to trust you what-so-ever after what they've gone through. Roleplaying? Nope, you're a good guy. Oh sure, you get some sarcastic responses and you can turn down a quest if you feel like not getting a reward, but the game all but forces you to be a 'good guy' who fights for the 'good guys', as if some guy frozen for 200 years and given no reason to trust anyone or anything afterwards would automatically know who they are. You will not ever be helping the raiders, nor is it even an option at any point in the game.

Which brings me to the next point, the voiced dialog and response system. Boy, it sure is fun guessing what my character will say with a four point prompt: Yes, No, Sarcastic, Question? But really, it doesn't matter in the end anyway. Any key decisions will have you railroaded into what you're 'supposed' to be doing anyway and for everything else it's just a matter of accepting or declining a side quest. The voice acting is awful and the male PC character always sounds bored or detached. I haven't heard the female voice acting yet so can't comment on that. And on another note, for the hearing impaired, the subtitles routinely don't match the dialog and the game's subtitling system routinely breaks and will get stuck on a paragraph of dialog while the conversation moves on. Just one small bug in a long, long list of them. And believe me, the amount of bugs and glitches that are in this game are staggering.

For PC users, this is a console port and it's a mediocre one. There are some keys you can't rebind and I honestly can't remember the last triple A game that didn't let you do this. There's no FOV slider either, which will make using the power armor a chore as its UI takes up a full 1/3 of your total screen space and any weapon larger than a pistol take up a full 1/4 of your screen space in or out of the armor. Fog looks terrible and the textures are low-res even on the highest settings. Skyrim looked a bit dated when it came out in 2011 and four years later it hasn't aged any better. The last open world RPG I played was Witcher 3 and this thing looks abysmal in comparison. 

All this being said, this game is what it is which is Fallout 3.5, 7 years after 3 came out. Running around killing, looting and exploring is the same as it was then and so if you enjoyed that then I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy that aspect of the game in this either. But shame on Bethesda for releasing a game like this and shame on everyone defending it. If it wasn't Fallout 4, if it wasn't Bethesda that made it, this game would be destroyed by gaming media and gamers a-like. The excuses of 'well, mod makers will fix it' is unacceptable. I am one of those mod makers and I shouldn't have to help fix a game I paid 70 dollars for because a lazy billion dollar game development company doesn't feel the need to improve its products. 

In conclusion, this game is not worth its full price. There are many better games out right now for that money and Bethesda is falling further behind the rest of the game industry with every game release. It's time, fellow gamers, for us to stop making excuses for Bethesda and start demanding better games from them instead of this lazy tripe they keep throwing at us.",30418,1432,76561197983841500,5,13.03 hrs

Bethesda Softworks over the last 3-5 years or so (and why you should probably not give your money to these scumbags) :

- Paid mods attempt no.1: failed horribly;
- Skyrim SE released, hiding the regular Skyrim from the Steam store (regular version has more mods, better mods, better mod compatibilty);
- Fallout New Vegas RU: apparently Bethesda considers the entire Central and Eastern Europe to be Russia now;
- Creation Club: aka Paid Mods attempt no.2. Yes, they claim they are mini-DLCs, but come on...fuc-king skins and microtransactions. The Nexus and the steam workshop are already filled with this kind of mods, even better ones;
- Skyrim Survival mode: You can get Frostfall and INeed/Realistic Needs and diseases for free on the Nexus, you know ? Also, they are more customisable and let's not forget that survival mode for Fallout 4 was free, just as the hardcore mode for New Vegas (Obsidian really raised the bar and you hate it Bethesda, don't you ?).
- Fallout 76, enough said..
- Selling nylon bags for ludicrous prices and scamming their customers.

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,5/19/2015,True,"Day 1 Review:

Pros
- No crashes
- Beautiful graphics (seriously)
- Runs smooth on a mid-range machine
- Top-notch aosphere

Cons
- I haven't seen boobs yet


*Actual Initial Impressions* (will continue to update)

Relevant Specs:
i7 2600k @ 4.4GHz
GTX 680 w/ 4GB RAM
8GB RAM
Windows 8.1

Actual Pros:

- Performance on my system has been better than expected (50-60fps @ 1080p). I am running postprocessing and the majority of the graphics options on HIGH. I have the hair-effect turned off as it does degrade my FPS.

- The world feels alive. From the wind blowing through the trees, to the dynamic weather system, to the wild life running through the forest, nothing stands out as generic or as an asset that was placed into the world without thought. The first two areas are more organic than any other game I have personally played.

- The side-quests are varied and offer up much more than fetch this or kill that. Many are investigation based and require multiple steps to complete.

- The UI has taken a MASSIVE step forward from The Witcher 2. What was once a clunky mess is now fairly intuitive and streamlined. There is room for improvement, but clearly the developers have learned from their past mistakes.

- The graphics are beautiful, but please don't expect a fully modded Skyrim or iCEnhancer GTA4 level of detail. Again, the developers seemed to be more concerned with making a world that feels organic and vivid than throwing 24k textures on everything. It's the art, color, and texture cohesion that really makes the graphics standout from other titles.

- The dialogue and voice acting are on par or better than most action RPGs I have recently played. I have yet to encounter two NPCs that I felt were using the same voice actor. The only generic voice in the game is probably the protagonist, but that is by design.

- I have not encountered any bugs worth mentioning. Zero crashes and no broken quests is impressive for any game when compared to other recent major releases.

Actual Cons:

- While the soundtrack and game ambiance are very well done, the game suffers from sound balancing issues. For example, at certain times the sound level of voices will be much lower than everything else in the world, forcing you to read the subtitles.

- There is an overuse of ""stage setting"" mini-cinematics, especially if you play in short bursts and load often. There should be an option to skip these and instead be able to read the suggestion text during a loading screen.

- Level progression has been quite slow which has forced me to back-pedal a bit from the main quest to play catch-up. This may be by design, but placing you into an area that is for level 7+ while you are only level 3 isn't the best choice IMHO.

Bottom Line: I will continue to play The Witcher 3 for the foreseeable future. It offers a blend of DA:I and Skyrim-esque gameplay with it's own unique lore, dynamism, and aosphere that is truly enjoyable.

779340,Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,5/27/2019,True,"My pedigree: ~500 hours Shogun 2 (+Darthmod), ~300 hours Warhammer 1, mostly played Very Hard.

I'm not a Total War expert but I understand most of its principles. Though I'm only a few hours into Three Kingdoms I'd like to point out some highlights here as most reviews I read were too abstract and didn't signal the major differences 3K has from older Total War games.

[u][b]Military:[/b][/u]
In general battles resemble Shogun 2 with its spear/sword/ranged/cavalry/siege basic archetypes. Units are arranged to maximize rock-paper-scissors match-ups, and generally volume wins. However there is the notable shake-up of:

[u]-Romance Mode-[/u]  this essentially makes the generals like heroes from Warhammer, for better or worse. Strong 1v1 generals will win battles, period. Dueling and killing generals will crush morale and cheese fights just like targeted damage spam from Warhammer. The AI is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot win, and even when they reject them you can simply right-click on them and get the same result. So far I have not seen any troops be effective against high-stat generals ‚Äî it's common to ouaneuver an invasion using your garrison troops to route the enemy only to have their general stick around and solo your remaining squads.

Of course if you don't like that you can simply play Records mode, which I haven't tried yet.

[u]-Roster-[/u]
Although all units fall into classic archetypes, there are more units than reviews insinuated. Most of these are gated behind general archetypes and technology. I can see these units substantially affecting the outcome of fights if you can afford them. An example: auto-crossbow units from high-Cunning generals will grant you a highly cost-effective ranged unit at the expense of a very weak general. This might be a good choice for a defensive army that has walls to garrison.

[u]-Military Supply-[/u]
This is the largest difference from previous titles in terms of military. All armies have a pool of 100 supplies that slowly fills in your own territory and rapidly drains in enemy territory and during the winter ‚Äî 30 lost to enemey territory, another 25 for winter (even in your own territory). Once your supplies hit zero you suffer massive attrition losses. This can be improved with infrastructure and character traits, but without significant invesents the net effect is that distant campaigns and prolonged sieges are extremely high-risk. Aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion. This, combined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacements, forces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense. Gone are the days of spamming Ashigaru to handle an unexpected attack, or endlessly raiding a territory while waiting for reinforcements. Likewise the AI can't use these strategies, solving the cat-and-mouse games everyone hated in Warhammer.

[u][b]Strategy layer:[/b][/u]
This is where I feel this game really shines compared to its predecessors. There are many new mechanics here that are brilliantly interlaced. One decision often begets 6 more, requiring lots of forethought.

[u]-Commanderies (a.k.a. provinces)-[/u]
This has been made far more complicated than previous titles. The game features a massive web of building trees, each replete with collateral effects and synergies that make you consider the province as a whole rather than the usual one-problem-one-building method we're used to. Compounding this is the commanderies system ‚Äî known as provinces in Warhammer, these are groups of territories that are designed to be held together. One territory of a commandery will contain the city and most of the buildings, while attached territories will contain an exclusive building tree. Because building synergies are so powerful you are highly incentivized to own an entire commandery instead of mere parts. This adds more intrigue to expansionist aggression as well as the excellent diplomacy system ‚Äî with good relations the AI will gladly trade territories of equal value with you.

[u]-Staff-[/u]
Managing your administration is a large component of 3K. Even with optimal buildings you will not have enough income without the right staff multiplying their benefits. Each staff's personality quirks will play heavily into what managing them will entail ‚Äî in general you want to hire like-minded people to reduce conflict and maximize satisfaction, but it is also important to hire personalities who satisfy the needs of your economy (vanguards are better for industry, commanders for peasants, etc). Black sheep can still be effective so long as they're kept away from their associates. Failing to satisfy them can have heavy consequences ‚Äî people with significant power in your government can even start a civil war. In my first run I found myself occasionally firing people I hired with insufficient foresight to avoid showering them in promotions or letting tensions boil over.

One final layer worth mentioning: all of these characters are persistent and historied, often having served other leaders before you. This mostly has implications with Espionage which I'm not experienced enough to talk about yet.

[u]-Diplomacy-[/u]
In Shogun 2 all of the leaders seemed like schizophrenics with borderline disorder, refusing trade and breaking alliances randomly. In Warhammer diplomacy was hardly possible at all. From that low bar 3K has made massive improvements. Leaders are generally more reasonable and fit their ascribed personalities well. Diplomatic intrigue has so far satisfied me more than any Total War or 4x.
The same diplomatic options from Shogun and Total War are present, but you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often. Items, payments, and marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreements, and territories can be traded to mutual benefit. Enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall. Cao Cao can stir the pot with the ability to start proxy wars.
The confederation system is the icing on the cake. Forging large confederations will require you to navigate carefully, as new members must be approved by a majority of existing ones, and voting in opposition of members will sour your relations. Furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak. That means order is important, and you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first. All of this complicates your expansionism, perhaps forcing you to take risks on distant campaigns rather than upset an ally, or an ally's-ally, by attacking your borders.

[b][u]Performance:[/u][/b]
If you're a Total War veteran you know why this section is here. I'm playing on [url=https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/15850243]this rig[/url] and the game runs flawlessly on a 2k 144hz monitor and looks great even with swarms of units on screen. If you're new to Total War and don't have an SSD, buy one. The more battles you have the more time you'll spend loading. I've been enjoying 5 second loads on my M.2.


[b][u]TL;DR[/u][/b]
In total the game becomes slow and deliberate compared to its predecessors, which largely devolved into paint-by-numbers spamfests. Controlled growth is key, and many decisions will require you to think several turns ahead. If you're playing Total War with an emphasis on battles with diverse armies and lots of spectacle you will be more at home in Warhammer, but hardcore strategists will love this game.

Among Us surprised me. I didn‚Äôt know this game existed until one of my friends urged me to pick it up and I‚Äôm glad I did. Among Us is a hidden role deduction game where up to 10 players are preparing their ship. You can either be randomly be a crewmate or an imposter. Crewmates are given a list of tasks, which can either be quick or long, that they should do. While they‚Äôre traveling all around the map, keeping their eyes open is key as they can walk past a dead body, even walk in on the imposter doing imposter-only actions, and making sure that crisis are taken care of. If you find a dead body, you‚Äôll get the option to report it and be sent to the discussion table so you can relay where you found it, who maybe was in the area or left, and hear what the others have to say in relation to alibis. You can also vote who you think the imposter is and if the majority agrees, they‚Äôll get ejected. Though, you can hit the emergency meeting button if you have some juicy information. If you happen to be killed, or wrongly voted off, you can still do your tasks. Dead crewmates unfinished tasks still count in everyone‚Äôs combined completion bar. There are also areas where you can loosely monitor everyone with security cams, a heart monitor, or detectors that loosely detect how many people are in a room or the thresholds they passed.

Meanwhile, imposters (which can be between 1-3 depending on the host) need to blend in. They‚Äôre given a list of fake tasks so they can go to the station and pretend they‚Äôre doing it, but you won‚Äôt actually get the screen. Of course, you need to make sure that nobody notices that the shared completion bar isn‚Äôt moving when you‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing tasks‚Äù. If you believe you and a crewmate are alone, and hopefully no one is going to come right around the corner, you can kill them and widdle down the cremate‚Äôs numbers (assuming the cooldown is done). You can also sabotage the crewmates by locking doors and causing crisis that will kill the crewmates if they don‚Äôt deal with it or hamper them such as lowering their visibility. You can also jump into vents to quickly get out of an area and act like you totally weren‚Äôt there or hide and suddenly jump out when a poor lone sole walks along. Hopefully, no one walks in on you or keep everyone‚Äôs suspicions off you and on someone else.

For the crewmates to win, they either have to find and vote out all impostors or have everyone complete their tasks. While imposters can win by killing most of the crewmates (if the number of impostors equal cremates, the impostors win) or hope that the crewmates totally ignore the crisis.

For the low price of $5, Among Us is definitely worth it. There‚Äôs still a lot of people playing, which was one of my concerns, there‚Äôs a good variety of tasks, and it is pretty fun (albeit the frustrations that come with playing role games with strangers). Of course, with games like this, it‚Äôs best to play with friends if you can since you can use Discord to voice chat instead of the in-game text chat. [strike]Though, right now there is a language barrier between English players and Filipino players only wanting to speak Tagalog (and random vote people even with evidence pointing to the real imposter) on English servers. However, I have heard the developers have made a Tagalog server/filter that is currently in beta.[/strike] FIlipino servers have left beta and added into the main version!

So after the overwhelming hype I decided to give Undertale a try, and I have to say I didn't really enjoy it. I see the appeal of it and understand why some people like it but it's just not for me. If I'm being brutally honest, this games feels like its being aimed at highschool-aged kids who think it's so funny to be ""random"" and love memes. I'm not trying to be highbrow but the humor absolutely did not click with me. Aside from a chuckle or two, I found most of the humor pretty grating and swinging at low-hanging fruit. Because I didn't really like the writing, I found the characters to be much less endearing than many others.

As far as the gameplay goes, it does turn the genre on its ear by introducing the bullet hell-styled fights. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of bullet hell games. I can appreciate the novelty and attempt at doing something different but like the writing, it just wasn't for me.

Story-wise and emotionally, the game didn't really move the needle for me. I never got invested in the characters and overall the game simply did not click with me. I really am disappointed that I did not enjoy it because To the Moon and LISA are some of my favorite games, with the latter (in my mind) superior in every way the Undertale. If there's one thing I really did like it would be the music.

I don't normally write negative reviews, but I wanted to for this game just in case there is someone who has the same tastes as I do and doesn't get swept up in the hype storm that is Undertale.

578080,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,7/29/2017,False,"Biggest turn off for me is that to do well you have to crank the graphics way, way, way down. On a bunch of occassions I would be hiding motionless in tall grass or a super dark shaddow and someone 100m+ away would spot me and pick me off really quickly. It made me scratch my head since on my screen I was virtually invisible. I tried turning my settings down and then I realized on low settings the darkness contrast between shaddow and direct sunlight is near zero - about 90-95% of the foliage and grass disappears - character models are super distinct against in game objects - low render distance means that character models still render at max distance, but all of their visual cover disappears (you can literally look through trees, bushes, and grass. It's like having a wall hack turned on). 

In summation - it's a really cool game, but I am not interested in playing with potato quality graphics. I didn't buy a PC so I could play games that look worse than last gen consoles.",92357,2839,76561198299643200,4,11.73 hrs

275850,No Man's Sky,8/17/2016,False,"Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat. Rinse, re‚Ä¶. wait, is that something ne‚Ä¶nope. Rinse, repeat.

No Man‚Äôs Sky, one of the most anticipated games for the 3rd quarter, couldn‚Äôt have been a bigger let down. The game basically got a running start at something great, then slowly got its head ahead of its feet and is now tumbling down head over heels into a smoldering pile of crap. I honestly don‚Äôt even know where to begin with this game.

First off, I have invested roughly 12.5 hours at the time of this review, and I cannot speak for any technical issues as I did not encounter any (not to say that there aren‚Äôt any).

The biggest issue with this game is there is absolutely no motivational factor to get you to complete this game or ‚Äòreach the center of the universe‚Äô. There is nothing to get you going or interested and even to want to begin that journey. Unless of course you enjoy stopping at trillions of planets ‚Äòprocedurally‚Äô generated along the way.

Every planet is incredibly repetitive. Yes you find a few new species and a hot planet rather than a cold, but unless you desire to find every species on that planet or just walking around smelling the flowers, you do exactly the same thing on every‚Ä¶planet‚Ä¶.you‚Ä¶.visit. You basically start mining and gather enough resources to launch yourself off the rock, warp, then arrive at the next system‚Ä¶‚Ä¶only to land and mine and gather enough resources to launch yourself off the rock, warp, then arrive at the next system‚Ä¶‚Ä¶only to la‚Ä¶.   Woops, almost thought I was playing the game there.

The ships and inventory of such are clunky and impossible to navigate. The only advantage to getting a new ship is its inventory space. Other than the outer shell of the ship, there is absolutely no difference in handling from the first ship you receive, to the ones towards the center of the universe. If you really desire your starting ship, all you have to do is upgrade your inventory‚Ä¶.. and once you‚Äôve got more storage? You have completed 25% of the game! The game is basically a journey of being able to store more crap in your pockets.

Do you like exploring and discovering new planets? Finding all the new animals and critters running around and getting to name them yourself? Well you obviously aren‚Äôt playing No Man‚Äôs Sky. The various alien races in the game are conveniently sitting in their huts all over every planet you visit. Not only that, but they must have had time to build a space station in every system. So in reality, you aren‚Äôt discovering anything, you are basically a tourist on vacation to the outer rim. Then there is the alien races language, I have managed to accumulate at least 250-300 words from the various races but I still have no freaking idea what any of them are saying! 

In the end, this game was a major let down, however the developers did a damn good job on getting everybody to board the hype train, but I could not recommend this game in its current state, not that it would ever change. This game could have been an amazing space exploration and discovery adventure, but it fails to deliver any of that, and will likely continue to fail. Very poorly executed. If the price falls (which it undoubtedly will soon) I could see someone purchasing this or if it falls within the $20-30 range, but until then, don‚Äôt waste your money or something deserving of an Alpha status.

But remember not to spend all your money if you do get it, the paid DLC is coming soon! To add what they said would be in the initial release!!

1056960,Wolfenstein: Youngblood,7/28/2019,False,"After RAGE 2 Bethesda drops yet another stinker.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood has so many problems I don't know where to begin.

The game takes place many years after New Colossus and BJ Blazkowicz's twin daughters have grown up to be annoying brats. It's almost like the developers played way too much Life is Strange and decided that they want to introduce a Chlo√©-esque character to the Wolfenstein universe, but not just one but two! ""Awesome right, dude?"" ""F'yeah dude! Very awesome, dude""

Which brings me to the next issue: this is a coop game. A forced coop at that. Even if you want to play alone you will have an AI companion, who wouldn't shut up for 2 seconds. The main objectives require both you and your human/AI partner to be alive, so if your companion is stuck elsewhere, then it's tough luck.
The game doesn't use checkpoints, but instead only saves your EXP and item progression.
What does this mean? It means if you and your partner run out of lives (3) then you are sent back to the beginning of the mission.
This can happen very often as AI tends to wander off and then get downed. If you don't save her in time, then that's -1 life even if you don't die.

Sounds fun huh?
Oh wait, but there's more!
There's no pause option in singleplayer.
Let that just sink in: There. Is. NO. Pause.

Alright, but is the shooting fun? Yes, it is. Granted if you are on the same level as your enemies.
Levels? What Levels? Oh, didn't you know? Youngblood introduces a tedious leveling system. Most story related activites are locked behind a level requirement, meaning even if you are very good at FPS games higher level enemies have so much HP and dmg it's not even possible to succeed. So have fun grinding the first few hours.

And to top all that up the game has microtransactions/in-game store.  
Not much needed to be said about this.

Overall thoughts? Game is crap, and after 2 crappy FPS games in a row from Bethesda, both containing microtransactions I'm seriously worried how DOOM: Eternal will turn out. But one thing is for sure: Bethesda ain't getting another first day buy from me.

- Graphics are great
- No performance issues 
- Gunplay is fun as long as you are in the same level range as your enemies
- Enemy variety is decent, with some new addtions (EG:Laserhund, Bombenhund) and some returning ones such as the Elite Guards

For newcomers: BEWARE. It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.

This review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.

MY BUILD 

CPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHz
Video Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAM
RAM: 12 GB
Storage: Hybrid HD-SSD

As you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.

GRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLD

Frame Rate (cap): 60.

V-Sync: Off. 
I rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. 
FPS cost: HIGH

Resolution Scaling: Low. 
The difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49"" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. 
FPS cost: LOW.

Texture Quality: 1024. 
Tested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. 
FPS cost: VERY LOW.

Ambient Occlussion: Off. 
Adds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. 
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Volume Rendering Quality: Off. 
This is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. 
FPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.

Shadow Quality: Low. 
The shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. 
FPS cost: HIGH

Anti-Aliasing: Off. 
I personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. 
FPS Cost: MEDIUM

LOD Bias: Low. 
This defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.
FPS cost: MEDIUM.

Max LOD Level: No Limit. 
Will switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.
FPS cost: LOW.

Foliage Sway: On. 
I want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.
FPS cost: VERY LOW.

Subsurface Scattering: On.
I like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.
FPS cost: LOW 

Screen Space Reflection: Off.
How objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Anisotropic Filtering: Off.
The detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Water Reflection: On.
I honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.
FPS cost: LOW

SH Diffuse Quality: Low.
There is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.
FPS cost: MEDIUM 

Dynamic Range: 64-Bit. 
Left on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.
FPS: LOW

Z-Prepass: On.
I honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.
FPS cost: LOW


After all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.

Had already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.

The game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.
Character customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)
You have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.
It has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.
It has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.
It has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.
You have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.
There's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. 
You can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say ""finish"", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.

Now, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. 
Disconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.

You will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.

Some users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.

Some users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.
Speaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.

Graphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.
If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.
If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.

Better yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.

So, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.",73240,1651,76561198036329900,12,11.33 hrs

The worst for me:

This game would have extremly high screenshot potential. Yet it works actively against anyone who tries to make good screenshots. There is no way to disable the cockpit view, and no external view. No way to disable the Hud. No way to pause without that the menu comes up. ect.
Maybe there are ways to do this stuff that i couldnt find yet, i didnt look into console commands or ini files or anything yet. There are probably solutions to be found for those things.

The rest of the bad stuff:

The UI is pretty bad, unintuitive. I mean the UI was bad in X Games before, but i wish the old system back after playing with the new one. The fact that they ""optimised"" it for using it with a gamepad makes it feel forced and bad with M&KB. The learning courve is pretty bad, also because of the bad way the UI is designed.

There are lots and lots of other minor things, like only one ship with 2 rooms where you can only freely move around in one and cant do anything than close or open a door. The ship stays allways the same besides of functional upgrades that have no optical effect as far as i know.

The Map is pretty much useless, the one in the former games was leagues ahead of the one they put in now. The stations interiors are looking pretty much the same everywhere. All feels lifeless and staged. The ""Persons"" in them look like manequins standing around, without any purpouse. And most of them look really horrible.

I could go on and on, this game is utterly rubbish in usability and immersion, yet it would hold still great potential if they would correct their errors and work on the game more. The core mechanics are there, and it does look pretty in space.

I am sure we will see lots of patches and probably also expansion packs / dlc. Which hopefully will improve on the rather bad first impression.

Dont buy this yet if you dont have a high tolerance for bad / unfinished gamedesign, take a look at it in a year, it might have matured to be something more likeable and playable by then.


Addendum:

.... somehow, after all this said.... it still drags me in.... somehow. 
I probably have a high tolerance, or maybe because i played all the former games...
The more you play it the less heavy the faults become, there is some truth to that.
Its more a thing of discovering new sectors and exploring, that feeling of adventure is still there to a point, for me.

Its just not as good as i hoped it would and should be *sigh*

At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.

X Rebirth is marketed in big bold letters as a trading game with a vibrant, reactive economy and NPC ships that go on trade runs simulating real economies. This is actually a load of tosh. More than 99% of ships (this is not an exaggeration) circle around stations in an endless loop, all caught up in a slow moving pointless traffic jam. They aren't going anywhere, have no goals and just keep doing this loop forever. The other ~1% seem to spawn next to stations then despawn when they are leaving them, never actually travelling to/from anywhere. It's all window dressing.

Not that it matters anyway, since trading doesn't even work. You'll have to do some really pointless trades (deliver 100 units of food when you can afford/store 100,000? What's the point?), and when you do you quickly find that the entire trading interface and ship control is totally buggy and doesn't work. Half the time player owned ships don't actually move when giving orders, and there's no way to view/delete the orders of ships in game. If your order bugs out you have to manually edit the xml files of your save game before trying again. If you eventually get them to move they frequently reach their destination then either get stuck staring at a station, or ram into it endlessly due to awful pathfinding.

Combat is really, really dull. You only ever get 1 ship, it can carry every type of weapon, but can only ever shoot one at a time and has no turrets or other hardpoints. EVERYTHING in this game is done manually. You can't automate anything. 

Walking around stations is... rubbish. It's full of copy pasted stations - which you'll notice by station 3 - and NPCs that only have 4 sets of dialogue and just repeat them over and over again. You're going to get incredibly sick of talking to random people about why they're all a bunch of racists, or why VR holodancers are sexy but not real. It's incredibly unengaging content and somewhat alarming how so much of the development time and focus of the game is on a feature that is not fun from the start.

A lot of people have been saying this game 'has promise'. That 'it'll be fixed in patches'. It won't. This game is defective by design. You can't just fix core fundamental game mechanics with patches. Even if they manage to fix the bugs it won't change the fact that everything in the game is completely lifeless and window dressed, rather than engaging or purposeful.

379720,DOOM,5/13/2016,False,"It's... sorta mediocre to be honest.

It runs really smoothly, is very well optimized and plays just fine.
It has good fast paced action, quick movement, no reloading, etc so there are no full stops or anything during combat.
Like, it's perfectly ok and playable and all, no glaring issues or anything that'd make you go ""Oh I hate this, this isn't fun at all"".

But at the same time there is nothing about it that really stands out, it just feels... generic.
The enemies, the sounds, the soundtrack, the enviroments, the story/background fluff, all of it is just so average.
Not terrible, but not quite good either. It wasn't a very memorable experience for me.

I think the biggest kicker for me, was how it lacked aosphere compared to say Doom 3 (which I actually kinda liked despite its issues). Everything is so well lit and clean, Hell looks more like the Desert of Knareen from Rayman 3 than HELL, and that kinda did bother me a bit.

But I dunno yo, get the game and see for yourself.
Maybe you'll like it, or maybe you'll feel kinda like some of us do, there is really only one way to find out.

When you do get it also (or rather, if), you might be able to finish the game in one sitting or two.
Took me about 10 hours to finish it on Normal start to finish, and I tried to explore every nook and cranny for about 2/3's of the game, so it could be 5-15 hours give or take depending on how much you care about collectibles and upgrades.
Ending was a cliffhanger too, so probably expect a sequel within the next 3 years also.

Cheers



Edit:

Unfortunately, because a lot of people seem to be illiterate or just overly aggressive in general I have to add a couple of points to this.

1) I have in fact played the original Doom games, and I liked those too.

I stated that I felt that Doom 3 had an overall better aosphere compared to this new Doom game, because it did in my honest opinion.
I never said ""Doom 3 was better"", ""Get Doom 3 instead"", ""I've only played Doom 3"" or whatever it is you are trying to imply.

What I liked about Doom 3 was the design of the weapons, monsters and enviroments, and had a lot of interesting world building stuff to it, like putting you in the game before the hell invasion happened, gave a bit of insight on the UAC facility, the people who worked there, etc
I always thought the game LOOKED pretty cool, even if the game had a bunch of flaws (like clunky combat, the annoying constant flinching when hit, basically total lack of a soundtrack, the annoying inconsistent shotgun performance, slower combat and fewer enemies, and so on).

WHY is it being noted?
Because this game has ALSO tried to do that, with the collectibles, etc
You can argue that ""Doom isnt about the story, lore or whatever"", because it isn't, and never was, not even in Doom 3 (the objective there was also always just ""you are faceless marine guy, go kill demons and stop hell"").
But you can't argue that they didn't try to add it to this, or get upset because I brought a feature, that is in this game, up, as being sorta generic.

It was not cited as ""not feeling like doom"", but I also never said that it felt like it either.
That part is up to you to figure out, because obviously we all seem to have different views on what ""doom"" is judging by the many comments and reviews.
If you feel (after playing it of course) that it is a true successor to the original Doom, then good for you, I'm glad. And if you don't, that's too bad. 
But it's still ultimately up to you to decide, not me.

I should also note that I have also played a bunch of Quake (I also liked Quake 4, fight me irl fam), and the Unreal Tournament series aside from Doom, for what it's worth, in case you are seriously gonna sit and judge and throw shit about my taste in past and similar games.

2) I never said ""don't get the game"".

I said that I thought the game felt incredibly average and that nothing in particular stood out, and that you should get the game yourself to make your own opinion.

It is marked as a negative review because Steam doesn't offer an in between, and I cannot honestly with a clear conscience say that this is ""the greatest game ever"" or whatever it is people want.

But despite it being an absolutely neutral review, and you being suggested to try the game for yourself, you somehow still find the time to abuse and hassle me over it. 
Like I just can't understand what part of ""it's not bad, but it's not good either, try for yourself though"" is hard to understand here.

I don't know whether to chalk this up to you not reading the review and instantly downvoting/call me a faggot for it, or you being salty as hell that I'm not giving this a +1.
But at least consider that it IS a review, and that you clicked it knowing this, so you kinda oughta at least read it first before going absolutely rabid in the comments.

- premium-account (are you crazy or what, Ubi?)

Edited from this line, to those who don't understand. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any premium features in MMO games (except for purely visual stuff like skins) are not made to make game experience better, - they are made so your experience is not WORSE. For example, if we take basic game experience as 100% - u're not getting 120% with premium features. In reality devs just take 100%, cut out 20% (sometimes 80% lol, check mobile titles) and sell it separately.In this game, for example it means that you have to invest 3 times the time to buy anything than you would have within a normal progression curve by a sane gamedesigner. Because they WANT you to buy it. They NEED you to buy it. And they will TWEAK your natural game experience so you buy it. I know what i'm talking about - I literally do this every day (working with free2play titles).

Do you realise that you are protecting the attitude that sees you purely as garbage with pockets? 
And again, for free2play this is fine, because basic experience is free. But here - it is not.
Because if we tolerate this crap and don't even say anything while getting screwed it will become much worse and very soon.
This happened to free2play. This happened to seasonpass bullshit. This happened to early access bullshit. And it will happen again with buy2play. 

As for p2p servers, I can PROMISE you a hell of cheats within a month. I can check packets with CE right now and it's purely undetectable. And also there's stuff like 0 ping for the host and disconnects and network errors.",8689,2320,76561197993673500,5,10.37 hrs

275850,No Man's Sky,8/14/2016,False,"Objectively not a bad game, but it is:
- Not worth its price
- Not in a release state performance wise, there is very frequent hitching.
- Not as advertised (I'm not talking about vague promises, I'm talking about fake gameplay trailers like this one here :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLEjqzg7M&feature=youtu.be&t=2m23s)
- Riddled with gameplay oversights and bugs

I cannot recommend this game, not because it is not worth buying at all, but because it is not worth buying in this current state at this current price.


= Story is an odd 6/10, because it is both interesting and way too scarce.
= Graphisms are a 4/10 at best, it's uglier than the fake gameplay trailers, and the procedural generation is VERY visible, the terrain barely has time to generate before you reach it. The planets do NOT look alike at all when comparing the view from space and on the ground.
= Sound is a 5/10, it's okay, and some creatures make really cute noises, but the UI voice is just obnoxious. Compared to Elite Dangerous this is even more prevalent since you can see what an amazing sound design, sounds like.
= Gameplay is a 3/10: The procedural generation is good, but the game revolves around constantly going back to the same small set of pre-built structures... What the hell?
= Controls is a 1/10: Flight gameplay is a horrible, Land gameplay is only passable because of a bug that enables you to move faster than you should.

377160,Fallout 4,11/11/2015,False,"I'm sorry, Bethesda. Not this time. I can't give you the thumbs up.

For those of you who are interested in a game with a simpified skill tree, little character customization and a mass-effect styled walk around the globe and do cool stuff game then this is definitely the game for you. It runs smooth enough and with mods can provide some very nice customization, though in its current state isn't very good for what it tries to achieve.

The system - 

Fallout 4 uses a tech tree style similar to Wolfenstein New Order (EDIT: I was wrong about Bethesda's involvement. It was my assumption from the loading screen of Wolfenstein that Bethesda was involved more heavily. I should have done more research, my bad. Understand as a lifelong fan of Fallout, from the very first DND-type games to New Vegas, I loved this series. To see it die infront of me had me shitposting like a king.) in which you spend your points on perks and unlocks rather than leveling up skills. There are no skills in the game as far as I can tell, you level up lockpicking 4 times and you get master/unbreakable (Which is only available at lvl 40 anyway, good luck with that.). You level up your science you can modify energy guns, but not make them. There's only a few energy/plasma weapons in the game anyway because they're all customizable but in a very small range of play. 

Armor crafting is even worse. They use a modular system, IE you can put on specific limbs, but it doesn't work with all clothing so if you want to wear a labcoat and a raider arm you can't. Have to use a harness or one of the modular pieces. So modular but not modular armor. You can upgrade your clothes and armor as well, unless it's anything but the vault suit, which can be given a lining upgrade much like the guns can get damage upgrades but you can't do this on labcoats or other items which usually count as clothes. Suppose that much is fair but for a game that prides item customization, it's lacking.

As far as buildings/settlements goes it's mediocre. Looks like a mod still in alpha. There's limited options, half the pieces in settlements don't have snap points and basically ARK did it better.

Dialogues are by far the most abysmal thing I've ever seen. If I wanted to play mass effect I'd go to Origin. Four options, your character talks. Now this might not be a big deal for some of you players but for people who enjoy a roleplaying game it's pretty unimmersive. The story is too complex for you to make your own adventure, the character you play has a preset route he has to go through and you merely choose the way he goes about it. In that sense it's sort of semi-linear but for me a deal breaker of the highest kind. In skyrim your options were very diverse, you could say and do a multitude of crazy things and due to the way the story was set up, you could imagine your character to be of any background and any way. Here, your dude bitches every 7 seconds about his military life and dead wife. It's not your character, it's bethesda's original OC do not steel. Sure you can melt his face but if you have no idea how to sculpt then you'll likely fail, and with no numbers or sliders you can't do specific tweaks.

Moving onto that, the face sculpter is an interesting idea but it's difficult to master. It's somewhat intuitive, has a few options and the triangular body slider isn't that bad of an addition but without the numbers you're at a disadvantage if you want something specific. It's more of a personal preference, but for those who enjoy making characters with defined features, saving presets and other such race-menu esque details, it's nigh impossible. A sidenote: Bethesda likes to limit your options by making you find comic books in the world to unlock hair styles and tattoos/scars for future playthroughs. While it's a good idea in theory, it ends up leaving you with only 20 hairstyles to start, though it's really not a big deal due to the barber only costing 15 caps.

Despite everything I know and love being ripped from the corpse of the game and simplified to a point where nothing matters, there are some significant improvements. For instance, your companions can dislike and like actions. If you steal infront of Codsworth, he gets salty about it and will even sometimes reprimand you for your choices. The charisma options are interesting as well, you don't have a flat fail rate you have a dice instead. If you convince someone, the difficulty of convincing them is shown in a gradiant of yellow to orange in the text of the ONE OF FOUR OPTIONS AAAA--

Sorry. It's just very disappointing. I suppose my summary for this game, and I might add on more to this review later, is go play Mass Effect, atleast the PC version wasn't a console port.

Edit: The thing that makes this game the worst, is it is SO different from past versions and the successful godsend Obsidian made that there's going to be too much work for modders to do. They're going to have to tear this FPS apart at the core to make it like it was. We were promised a roleplaying game, something where we can design our own characters and have broader choices.

Edit: 6/15/2019

This recent sale only makes this worse, the game is $27.99 on SALE if you don't already have the original. Dark Souls 3 Deluxe /w the season pass is only $21.99.

Imagine trying to convince /anybody/ new to the Souls series to buy this pile of shit, when the original game was like $4, then got removed from the Steam store, and now it's the most expensive game in the series despite just being a poor touch-up of the first to PC.

Oh, also, these comments sure did age well. Comedy gold. Dark Souls is in my opinion, the best game ever made yet people were quick to trash me. Instead of seeing my disappoinent with the mishandling of this beautiful game from a veterans point of view, many of you chose to make personal insults and argue semantics.

At this point, I feel FromSoft has long since moved away from what made this game so enjoyable for me. I loved the pace of combat and the overall gameplay, so much that it causes me to dislike Dark Souls 3 for its differences. So here it is, my favorite game ever made, one I have beat a hundred times. A game which certianly did /not/ function correctly in its original state, despite what many of these commenters seem to think.

Multiplayer didn't work, it simply didn't even with DSCfix in the GFWL days and DSCM in the post-GFWL time there was always high levels of jank. ""Summoning failed"" and ""Failed to invade"" were the messages of the day. 30fps was unacceptable as was 768p locked resolution. All the fixes came with their own problems, like getting stuck at a bonfire in a softlock if you restored humanity. Falling through the world when sliding down the ladder near the sunlight bonfire. Seath's attacks and crystals having anti-aliasing applied to every damn crystal and particle would crush the framerate. The game was and is plagued by cheaters, to a really unacceptable degree which defeats the entire spirit of it.

Dark Souls is a mess. I wanted it done right. We didn't get that, in the end. Still don't believe me? SotFS has 2,353 players online right now while DS:R has 1,778. The first Souls game has more or less always had consistently more players than Dark Souls 2, up until May of 2018. The same month that this overpriced abomination came out, replacing the original game on the Steam store. Slicing the DS1 community into two halves, burning away remaining interest of the game in a short couple of months.

Oh, and instead of fixing twinking they made it even harder still to be a sunbro, while still 100% allowing twinking. Thanks FromSoft for making multiplayer just as janky and confusing as ever on your way out, before dropping this game like a hot rock and moving on.

262060,Darkest Dungeon¬Æ,10/1/2015,False,"Games like this are the reason why I really wish Steam's ""do you recommend"" question had more than just two options. Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game... to a certain breed of gamer. Let me explain.

First, the good.

[i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a masterfully crafted game. The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth. The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the ""hard"" end of the spectrum. Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered.

The stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games. The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the [i]Cthulhu[/i] games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here.

Oh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game.

The game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that. It's not bad. In fact...

[b]KR Rating: [5] GREAT[/b]

But wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad. As I said before, [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a hard game.

Well, no, that's not really accurate. [i]Etrian Odyssey[/i] is hard. That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too. [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is not hard, it's unfair.

See, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called ""curios"" in the game) that litter the dungeons. Then you get into that one battle. You know the one I mean. It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard. It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time. Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit. Before you can even click the ""retreat"" button half your force is at Death's Door... or through it. It's a little like [i]Dark Souls[/i] in a way.

And the thing is, that's not an accident. I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is. This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point. It's the underlying design philosophy of the game.

The developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate.  There are no badasses in the [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i]. There are no heroes.

No, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good. (This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier.)

That's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just ""recommend"" or ""not recommend."" Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made. It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be. It is a GREAT GAME.

But ""great"" and ""universally enjoyable"" are not the same thing. A lot of people don't like hard games. I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people.

If I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority.

That said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now. It's only $19.99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist.

If you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one.

297130,Titan Souls,4/15/2015,False,"Let me be completely honest.  I can tolerate hyper difficult games.  I enjoy them for the most part.  But when I see poor game mechanics implimented in games, I have to be honest and explain WHY they are poor choices.  At the time of this review, I have now not only completed the game on normal difficulty, but I have done the new game+ (HARD) version.  To this point I am going off my experiences through the entire game, including the last boss fight.

This game is difficult, there are no beans about that.  Unfortunately, alot of the difficulty is not based on the challenge alone.  It is a game that tries your patience, over your skill (I will explain this in a bit).  These are reasons why I feel that I cannot unilaterally recommend this game, and I have to give it a thumbs down.  It is clearly not for everyone, and in more ways that one, I find that it is not entirely enjoyable for me, especially not for the price tag involved with the game (15 American Dollars).

So that being said, lets break down what the game does right:

1)  The graphics: THe game looks good.  The pixel art is fun, and enjoyable.  The style is fine, and the world looks good.
2) The sound:  The sound effects are not an ear sore.  They are appropriate and engaging, so no complaints there.  The music is excellent, and one of the reasons to pursue the sound track.  With an exception of some odd choices (one of the bosses has a ""metal"" sounding rock anthem, which is distinctly OUT OF PLACE with the rest of the game.  Not a bad piece of music, just seemed out of place in my opinion.
3) Gameplay: What you get in this  title is a solid two button experience, that ends up being a remarkably solid experience (bad and good)  If you can stomach is the problems with the game, you will be treated to a very stable experience.

Now those three things are not inherently bad, and can lend you to an fun time.  The problems with the game however, outway these good things.  So lets dig into what I have problems with.  Understand, that while this may seem nit-picky, I will argue that it is not.  The things that this game does wrong, are damn near game breaking in their simple essence.

1) Your one method of attacking in this game renders you immobile, as does your button activated retrieval of your weapon.  This game is all about mobility.  The bosses are relentless in their assaults, and you need to keep moving to prevent getting killed.  Now, I understand that the game is designed with this problem in mind, but that does not change the fact that the problem is a problem regardless.  From a design perspective, there is no reason NOT to allow movement while charging your attack to release, nor is there a legitimate reason to prevent movement while retrieving your weapon.  This ""freeze and charge your weapon"" mechanic is out dated, and serves to add a ""frustration"" element to the games difficulty, as opposed to legit skill based difficulty.  Again, don't get me wrong, I understand that the timing is technically skill based.  The bottom line is that this mechanic is largely frustrating, will probably be the #1 cause of deaths in the game, and really should have stopped being used in games a long time ago.  Unless the characters weapon is an English Longbow that requires him to take a knee to fire (which NONE of the concept art would alude to), there is no reason he cannot walk and draw the bow at the same time, even if it slows his movement down.

2) There is absolutely NO reward system for this game.  There is no player growth.  There is no score, there is no story.  There is literally NOTHING that motivates the player to do what they are doing beyond the simple idea of trying to do it faster than you did the last time.  (achievements do not count in this regard, I know they are there, but I am talking about the core game not tacked on challenges for bragging rights.)  This is great for speedrunners, but no so good for pretty much EVERYONE ELSE, especially considering the game (on the easiest difficulty) requires frame perfect execution of technique that spans a window of .65 seconds to actually terminate a boss in some cases.  Having trouble with an annoying boss?  There is no way to out level the challenge, and no way to give you any more advantage beyond continuing your struggle and hoping that the cards finally fall into your favor during the fight so you can get the perfect kill.  This cripples the games accessability to a large portion of an audience that would otherwise play this game, much less pay the 15 dollar initial asking price.  Part of the challenge is identifying the way to beat a boss... the rest of actually managing to pull off what is required to do it.  The game is also at least 20 minutes long from start to finish.  While the lack of complexity is actually refreshing in a way, I unfortunately feel the impact on my enjoyment alot more due to the other issues with the game, like... -

3) This game instantly kills you.  There is no health bar, when you are hit you are dead.  Now this in of itself is not a bad thing.  This is a great mechanic, especially when the same thing happens to the bosses when you hit their weak spot.  What hurts this mechanic is the lack of ability for the character to just instantly repeat the fight.  Under most situations in the game, the save point is close to 45 to 1 and a half minutes away from the boss.  Now this may seem quick and trivial, but understand that it is possible to die in some bosses within 5 seconds of the boss fight starting.  This adds up, and not in a good way.  One concept to understand in level design, and gameplay, is that of ""Player morale"".  You want your player, despite difficulty, to keep pressing forward to try and overcome the challenge, without driving them away.  This game has no concept of this reality.  There were several boss fights that I initially found fun, but after spending close to 15 minutes TOTAL in walking from the save to the boss in between fights, I found that my entertainment was wearing thin.  There are so many other games before this one that have shown the proper way to do this (including Shadow of the Collossus) that I do not understand WHY they decided to impliment this annoying delay in progress.

In closing, I can forgive the ball busting, totally devestating frame perfect difficulty that this game's normal mode offers.  I can even find myself enjoying it.  I find it cool that there are other modes to unlock after you manage to complete the game including a harder new game plus, among other modes to extend your game time.   I am, however, a mixed bag of opinions, because part of me finds the rest of this game fun, and there really are only three major problems that are holding this game back from greatness.   I doubt the game will ever be patched to fix these issues, and should by miracle, the developers actually take advice and fix the problems, I will be willing to re-visit this review.  As it stands though, this game is not only, not for everyone, but I find that I am hard pressed to even recommend the game to fellow hardcore gamers like myself.  The game mechanics are just that, the game is designed around them, and if you are willing to ignore, and or cope with them like I am, then you may find something enjoyable in this game.  But like it or not, just because you design a game around bad game mechanics, does not make those game mechanics any less annoying and terrible.  Gold plated poop is still poop.  The devs had me excited for this game for quite some time, and watching people play the game who have overcome the limitations can be very fun to watch.  But playing the game is a whole different story, and I can only recommend investing in this title when it is for 5 american dollars or less.",36111,1053,76561198040367600,23,9.60 hrs

578080,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,9/29/2017,False,"Honestly I thought I would really enjoy this, but that is not the case.

It's buggy as hell. I appreciate it's still early access but they've got the funding. They have a button on the main page to 'refresh the UI incase it's buggy'. If that isn't an indicator of what to expect I don't know what is.

Performance is terrible. People with modest rigs still suffer from poor fps.

It's so clunky. Things you can't walk up or climb over are just beyond frustrating. Putting your gun to a window or over a desk prevents you from doing so. When you think you're picking up ammo off the floor, you end up picking the gun instead, you switch back but then have to reload the gun again, even though it was previously loaded.

The maps are so large half the time it feels like a walking simulator. You spend 50% of your time staring at the floor for items, 49% walking and 1% shooting.

The general gun mechanics are strange. There's been several times I've pumped a full round into someone (the blood spats are an indicator it hit) and the player is still alive and shoots you dead in one. Other times I've shot someone with a shotgun from 25 meters away and killed them in 1 hit.

The devs themselves are poor too and act like children. It's just a massive cash cow now. Here's why: 
- Bringing in micro transactions during early access is just unethical especially after the amount it's made in sales, there's no excuse.
- Bringing in micro transations when they clearly stated they didn't. So that was a massive lie.
- They ban people for stream sniping and even those that aren't. There's no care for their players. They support the streamers because it's their way of marketing and getting more sales.
- They ban people from their forum that have posted a polite opinion.
- They cry when another company ""steals"" their idea, even though battle royale style games has been around for years.",99681,1836,76561198055571800,4,9.53 hrs
1128000,Cube World,9/30/2019,False,"[b] It's hard to figure out why things went wrong with this game, features and content were teased, everyone liked what was shown, but then the game got released and a lot of people were surprised when they realized they were playing an entirely different game than what was promised. [/b]

I'll start by listing the changes when comparing the game to the alpha version, a lot of people, myself included, believe the alpha version was (while not perfect) unquestionably good and promising, many hours of fun were had and it is quite baffling to see the state of the beta right now.

-The XP and skill tree system was entirely removed in favor of an artifact and gear-based progression system. The player gains health and attack power among other stats through collecting better gear that drops randomly in the wilderness or dungeons, additionally, artifacts can be collected to get better stats such as lamp radius, climbing/swimming speed, etc. which sounds and IS entirely useless on top of having diminishing returns.

-Instead of having a procedurally generated map for every playthrough, your map is already generated and mapped out on your arrival, the only thing randomized is your spawn point. For an exploration game (as Cubeworld was meant to be initially) this is one of the dumbest changes.

-Various areas, ""regions"" if you will, are separated by borders, if these borders were purely aesthetic or had indicative purposes, it wouldn't be much of a problem. But your gear and transportation items (boat, reins, glider) are tied to the region you found them in. This means that when you step out of the boundaries of a region to explore another region, your gear becomes useless (stats get reduced to nearly 0 which in turns sets your health and other stats to the default values) and your transportation items are unusable, this makes exploration impossible as most conceive it since you have to re-find the transportation items in the new region (unless you want to slowly walk across) as well as finding new gear so that you don't get steamrolled by the enemies.

-Staying on the topic of gear, currently, the drop rates seem to be pure RNG, you might find a legendary weapon/armor inside of a log or by killing a mob within the first 10min of your playthrough, or never in 10 hours.

-Towns have been all downgraded aesthetically speaking, previously class masters would have their building themed after their class, now there is only ""the guild"" a copy-paste of the same dull building. Towns are also simply smaller and uglier for some reason.

-Dungeons have also been downgraded, castles have now four towers of the same height and a flat top as opposed to the previous complex design, and the mobs inside dungeons don't always have stats that make sense, you'll mow down green mobs in the initial stage and end up with a legendary boss with more hp than all the mobs in a ten-mile radius, bosses can sometimes do 0 damage to you for most of the fight and one-shot you with one special attack that you can simply dodge if you know it's coming.

-On the topic of mobs, some of them can't even be damaged if you don't have rare gear, in the alpha version you could take on much stronger mobs than yourself if you were resourceful and fought with strategy in mind, now you're barred from fighting specific mobs if you don't have the gear required.

-Crafting is now borderline useless, weapon/armor crafting is useless for sure since they disappear when you cross borders but also because you have to unlock recipes tier before you can even craft them and will generally already have better gear by that point, the only reason to craft things is to get heat/cold tolerance items in certain areas and potions to get health.

We ended up with a game that:
-Punishes exploration 
-Rewards mindless farming which in turns makes gameplay repetitive
-Doesn't contain most of the features planned/teased (capital cities, meaningful faction interactions, faction leaders, long questlines, new races/classes/customization options, etc...) a lot of good alpha features were even simply removed.

Criticism can also be addressed towards the lack of communication from the developers (no communication at all, ever)
Censorship has taken place on Reddit, the Steam forums and Discord where valid and constructive criticism was often hidden/deleted/censored under the guise of toxicity/insults where none were to be found.
There were excessive bans, often, which didn't help to establish meaningful discussions.
For some reason people were able to put out reviews before the game was even out, somehow most of the reviews were positive, solely based on the fact that ""it's been 6 years"" and not on actual gameplay experience. The few people that dared write constructive negative reviews received baseless criticism from the wollay-defense force (yes we have reached this point), the same goes for anyone raising issues on the various social media platform.

This release is an epic failure that bewilders and confuses most people who played the alpha version of the game. If you completely forget about the alpha, the beta version of Cubeworld is still a very mediocre game, it is fun for the first 2-4 hours or until you complete your first region (which can happen quite fast if you get lucky with rng) but then gameplay gets bland and repetitive).

I personally honestly wanted this game to be good and I simply can't understand why all of the changes took place.

583950,Artifact,11/30/2018,False,"When you start the game for the first time and go trough tutorials, you're met with a pop-up message that claiming and opening your free packs makes this game non-refundable on Steam platform. Despite that red flag I accepted and continued to play for 2 days straight, before being met with a cruel realization that this game has many more microtransactions than I expected.

You start the game with 5 tickets and 10 card packs.
How to get more card packs:

[*]In order to get card packs, you need to use tickets that allow you to play in special game modes.
[*]The special game modes are just a highly RNG based (minus one) PvP battles (Not to mistake with TES:L PvE Arena system).
[*]One of these game modes allows you to draft 2 cards out of 5 pools of 10 cards and keep them after the game, but to start this mode you need to spend 2 TICKETS and 5 UNOPENED CARD PACKS.
[*]after you start one of the special games that consume tickets, you need to win minimum 3 games against other players, with maximum of 2 loses to get anything at all out of it. And that is just a refund of a ticket. Otherwise it's 1-3 tickets and 1-3 card packs, depending from wins.
[*]In case you didn't win 3 times and already lost 2 times, you get absolutely nothing and your used ticket/packs are gone.
[*]Or scratch all that and you buy card packs for roughly $2, because it's simply unlikely to win anything with the amount of out-of-control RNG that is going on in this game (No joke, it even randomizes the direction in which your creeps/heroes are going to deal damage)

Other ways of getting cards:
[*]Selling and buying them on Steam Market. However keep in mind that all the good cards are going to be much more expensive than any common board-filler. Many of them being more expensive then the card packs themselves.

How to get more tickets when you spent all of them on the game modes in hoping to win card packs:
[*] You spend irl money, around $5 per ticket.
[*] Recycling 2 card packs worth of cards (20 cards) to get 1 ticket.
[*] That's about it.

To sum it up - I really, REALLY hoped this game would be much better than what everyone else already guessed it to be. And I would lie if I said it wasn't a brand-based purchase.
Even with the crazy amounts of RNG, the game itself is pretty good, but the amount of paywalls is indeed downright disgusting. Some articles said you can play this game without spending any money, but how do you even expect to fight people who actually bought/earned enough cards to build reliable decks?

I do not recommand this game in its current state. The microtransactions are ridiculus. I only hope someday it will get a reasonable update with ways to get cards without spending money.

The fact alone you need to BUY an online card game is crazy enough.

EDIT: Isn't that just ridiculus in itself that people would need to come up with some plans and financial strategies to overcome the paywalls/make it worth your time?
Instead of advocating such behaviors and thinking workarounds, it should be brought down to the ground level and call it what it is - a ridiculus amount of microtransactions.",95023,1255,76561198033664200,4,9.40 hrs

A lot of ppl do like MOBAs, no im not saying this is a MOBA but boy it sure shares a lot in common with one.

The graphics 7.5/10      I dont care what ppl say the graphics are a big step down from DOW2, they do look cartoony they do look less detailed, there are colorful little effects surrounding your tiny little guys. I cant help but be reminded of a Blizzard game here, looks like Diablo 3 kinda.

The sound 6/10 Sound effects are underwhelming, you constantly hear the little shots of the various guns but its just pew pew pew...The voice acting, OH GOD the voice acting.  The space marines sound like a bunch of normal guys around their late 20s...Gabriel sounds like 28 year old dood trying to do a poor English accent...These are supposed to be 7ft5in super soldiers with centuries of battle experience...im not hearing that conveyed in their tone.

The Gameplay...WELP here is real issue the dividing line amongst the players, some like me will be extremely bummed out with the direction they have gone with this series, others will love this style of gameplay.   Essentially you have lil unimportant units that are just kinda there they dont really matter, While you kinda play with your Hero units in a sort of ARPG kind of way, got your cool down skills...etc etc  

They chose to abandon the depth of a traditional RTS game and instead made it very much more action oriented. I found myself really really bummed out that there was no cover system. I mean WTF Relic you guys pretty much invented and mastered the environmental based cover system which was awesome. Your guys would cover behind a tank or a wall or a ditch in the ground..None of that here its either magic bubble or nothing..which REALLY sucks, REALLY SUCKS.

OH and the campaign, I hate this ""lets make them play as each faction"" BS...I HATE THAT what was wrong with the way Dark Crusade did things? Pick the faction YOU WANT TO PLAY AS, then battle over territories on an entire planet...That felt awesome, not this contrived way to make us play as a faction we dont want to. I dont wanna play as an Ork I dont want to play as an Eldar.   

As for future races, god look how weak the Space Marines feel, they drop like Guardsman how the hell would the Tau feel (all ranged anyways but still) or the Imperial Guard for that matter... AND NO DAMN SYNC KILLS???!?!?!?! That was one of the defining features of the DOW series that made it DOW...it was unique amongst RTS' it was awesome it was neat it made it feel like you were watching an actual fight for life and death unfold infront of you..They have clearly chosen to cater to the esport crowd the MOBA crowd and I cant help but feel jaded.

Bottom line maybe i got rose colored glasses on but when a series you loved that seemed special among the faceless masses suddenly turns into just another one of the masses it stings...This game has no personality, nothing about it sets it apart, nothing about it is cool...Its a 5/10 game, maybe 6/10 game I doubt we will see a  DOW4.

1190460,DEATH STRANDING,7/16/2020,True,"To preface: This game is not even close to being for everybody. If you are looking for an action or combat oriented experience, this is not the game for you.

Kojima was not at all kidding when he said Death Stranding was a walking simulator. However, it is quite possibly the only walking simulator that actually simulates walking. If you're still confused about what exactly you do in this game, as I was, you deliver packages on your back in a surreal sci-fi post-apocalypse. For reasons explained by the lore, that I shall not get into for spoiler purposes, the last remnants of humanity are isolated inside of fortified cities, and are unable to leave. Because they are unable to leave, and because planes and drones no longer work, they rely on so-called porters to deliver goods from settlement to settlement by hand. You play as one of these porters.

Almost everything in the game is in some way focused on delivering packages. The story and your character's part in it are a little more grandiose than simply delivering packages, but that is still the foundation upon which everything else is built. A standard mission consists of picking up an order at a settlement, arranging the goods on your back and on your suit in the most organized way so that you don't tip over from the weight, plotting a course to the place you have to walk to, and then walking there. This may sound very basic and boring, but the game does a surprisingly good job at making traversal a challenge that is just as interesting and engaging as combat.

The terrain is incredibly rough, and you will need the help of various tools to get to where you're going without damaging the goods. There are also two types of enemies that can get in your path: crazed bandit types who will try to steal your packages, and invisible enemies that can completely ruin cargo, and need to be stealthed around using a sort of marco polo mechanic, where the mechanical doo-hicky on your shoulder points to where the enemies are. The invisible enemies only come out in the rain, which damages your cargo due to story reasons; so it creates an interesting dynamic of trying to escape them as soon as possible to get out of the rain, while also not rushing through it and getting caught by them. 

On top of all this, there is a pseudo-multiplayer mechanic. You can place useful structures in the world to be used by yourself and other players, and you can use things placed by other people. You will also find various lost bits of cargo in the world that you can deliver for bonuses. Some of these lost packages will be randomly generated by the game, and some of them will be left behind by other real players. It's also possible to leave packages at safehouses for other players to finish the delivery, and you can pick up things left by other players and finish their deliveries too.

Overall, a strange and somewhat divisive premise has lead to what is, in my opinion, an extremely unique and engaging game. This is not even touching upon the story, which has that signature Kojima charm of being completely incomprehensible but also very symbolic and chock full of social commentary. My only major glaring complaint is that there is a baffling Monster Energy Drink product placement. Whenever you rest in a room, there are lovingly rendered cans of Monster on your nightstand. Your canteen in the game also magically converts water into Monster Energy Drink. I wish I was kidding. This is completely shameless, and honestly subtracts quite a bit from the game's artistry, but it's not a big enough deal to warrant getting fussy over.",8228,1392,76561198107363700,15,9.33 hrs
391540,Undertale,7/16/2016,False,"I am going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but... screw it!

I don't like Undertale.

I already hear the uber fans clicking the downvote button and booing me since that's what they did to everyone else who had an opinion on the game, but hear me out. Undertale is definitely not the worst game I have ever played, it's not really even bad. In fact, I am impressed by some of the features that were coded into the game.

Then why don't I like it?

Well for one, the humor of the game relies too much on meme-like humor. This already completely dates the game as memes come and go fairly quickly on the internet. In 5-10 years the humor will most likely be pretty unenjoyable because it relies too much on current-day meme humor/culture to be funny instead of... actually being funny. So many people praised it for its comedy, but I generally found myself getting annoyed at all the ""jokes"". I haven't really seen many smart jokes that were actually genuinely funny and the ones I did see were too few and far between. 

Now I could look past the terrible jokes if the characters were great, but I could not really relate to any of them, so I found it hard to care about them. All of the characters seemed to be defined by quirks rather than an actual personality like characters out of an M. Night Shymalan flick. While quirks can be funny if done right, most of the characters relied on meme humor and just come off as annoying. I'll admit though, some scenes with Payprus were genuinely funny, but one thing dragged it down... The annoying and piercing sound that kept playing everytime he talked. Everytime a character talks in this game, they emit some of the most annoying sounds I have ever heard and it really makes it hard to care for them when their death means that the noise will finally stop. There are also other characters in the game that will interrupt your gameplay to show you that they made a social media post... 5 times... in one minute. I counted. It's annoying as shit. So yes, the characters everyone else praises and says made them get ""the feels"", I could not stand at all and just wished that they would die.

Which brings me to another con with the game. Morality and how it is treated in Undertale. This is one feature that everyone kept talking about. ""It's an RPG where you don't have to kill anyone, it's so unique, it has not been done."" Wrong. It has been done and it is not very unique. I mean Postal 2 also allowed you to play the game without killing anyone. Anyway, morality all kind of boils down to two different paths: Kill=Bad and Mercy=Good. I find that setting the scene is a great way to understand the flaw here. You are walking along a path when a floating horse thing jumps out of the bushes and tries to strangle you with its muscles.... just go with it. You dodge his attack, but now he starts to sweat bullets at you, clearly trying to murder you. He shows no signs of stopping so you attempt to protect yourself, killing him in the process. you're not evil, right? Wrong. The game says that you are automatically evil because you hurt that poor defenseless creature and you had the option to run away and risk getting shot in the back by him or flex with him and hope that he just goes away. If you kill, the game starts whining about how much of a monster you are and how you are disgusting because you kill for the fun of it and you are left thinking, ""But they kind of were trying to murder me..."" 

Another problem I have with this game is that there are never really any tough decisions to make. Once you play for a half hour, you realize that the game offers you the choice to kill everyone, but really discourages that playstyle. Thus, there is one ""right"" way to play the game which I really hate. Why are there no decisions where you don't know if you made the right choice? One of the tags for this game is ""choices matter"" and while that is true to a certain exent, all of the ""choices"" feel a bit one sided. It is apparent that there is one path the dev wanted the players to take and that is perhaps the most disappointing part of the game. 

Combat in the game is fairly interesting... for the first five minutes. It gets old fairly quickly and I found myself dozing off during many of the ""boss battles"" which is not good for any game, particularly an RPG. The boss battles are supposed to be some of the most exciting parts of an RPG and... they're just not. The gameplay boils down to move your heart around a little bit every so often and avoid the falling or moving stuff.... that's it.

Finally, my last problem with the game is .... the graphics! I know, I know! Graphics don't make a game good! Don't judge a book by its cover! bla bla bla. Believe me! I agree! I have been using that same argument for years to get friends to try some of my favorite games. But all those other games made up for their graphical limitations with a distinctive art style. Hotline Miami looked really good because it mixed a great neon look with a good amount of blood and gore. Rogue Legacy had very good backgrounds and level design to get the player engaged in the game. Nidhogg has a nice contrast of colors for its levels. Undertale... has...  a dog with a very long neck? I could like this game a lot more if it had any sort of art-style or good level design to make the world we are exploring more interesting, but it all looks so... bland. The scenery is a bit boring and uninspired and the world itself feels pretty empty and dead. ""But when you get in combat the enemies have a distinct artstyle!"" True, but they all looks like they belong in memes which generally just makes me annoyed. Their design does not look very interesting or unique... and that really kills it for me. 

Overall, I can barely stand to play this game, but I understand why some people would like it. To them it's funny and emotional, I definitely did not get the same feeling and I personally would not suggest it. To me, it is not worth ten bucks and I would wait for it to get a big discount before buying it. Also, If you are an Undertale fan, but have read this far, I would like to congratulate you for keeping an open mind. And please, don't downvote me just because I don't like the game. If you believe my review is misguided and does not bring up any good points, then that is a good reason to downvote. Thanks for reading!

[h1]Edit:[/h1]

Some people were asking about the stuff I did like in the game. Well, I did enjoy the music for the genocide route quite a bit and while I was not particularly a fan of the music in the pacifist route, I can still admit that it was good music. Also, I thought the concept of having certain characters recognize when you jump between save points was a pretty interesting idea and pretty unique too. Considering this was all designed by one guy, I was fairly impressed by how loading savepoints from every point in the game was taken into consideration for these specific encounters. And like I said earlier, there were some moments that were legitimately funny, such as some papyrus scenes, but some of the sound design in those segments really detracted from the experience for me. The lore seemed like it could be very interesting, but I do believe it needed to be fleshed out a bit more than it was. For instance, more time could have went to building interesting environments since an environment in a videogame can be just as effective at storytelling as any dialogue.

391540,Undertale,10/4/2015,True,"Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don‚Äôt really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying ‚ÄúI have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!‚Äù and make a getaway? Think about it. How many times do you beat up Balrog in [i]Cave Story[/i] only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pok√©mon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?

[i]Undertale[/i] asks the question, ‚ÄúWhat if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?‚Äù

This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but [i]Undertale[/i] will also pit you against several main characters. If you defeat a main character in battle, they‚Äôre dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it. Heavy stuff.

But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don‚Äôt actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting. This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the ‚ÄúAct‚Äù menu in battle. The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you‚Äôre fighting; sometimes you‚Äôll just need to give them a compliment, other times you‚Äôll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on. Once they‚Äôre not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can ‚Äúspare‚Äù them, and the battle ends. You won‚Äôt get any EXP for it, but you‚Äôll still get gold. It‚Äôs a very unique fighting mechanic!

I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story‚Äôs presentation. I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game‚Äôs content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else. The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone. ‚ÄúWhy is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?‚Äù I asked myself. ‚ÄúWhere are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?‚Äù

Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone‚Äôs life. I wasn‚Äôt playing as a murderer. If you want this game to have drama, [i]you have to cause it.[/i] And I think that‚Äôs where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice. This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between. You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won‚Äôt let you ignore what you have done.

Though it isn‚Äôt the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn‚Äôt always the best, [i]Undertale[/i] has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art. It tried some new and ambitious things and isn‚Äôt ashamed of what it wanted to be. It's about 6 hours long; I‚Äôd recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer. It‚Äôs hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience.",5103,9355,76561197993891100,106,8.62 hrs

712100,Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia,5/3/2018,False,"I own every Total War Game from the first Shogun:Total War to the Warhammer 2, I even bought Rome: Total War just last year for the sake of old memories but its with a heavy heart that im writing a negative review for a Total War game. Overall, this wasn't meant to be a ''full'' game as we all know its basically a re-skined Attila total war and I didnt not expect much when i pre-order it, but Its way too dumbed down for a Total war player of over 15 years.

Firstly, the new food upkeep. In Thrones of Britannia, every unit need food upkeep. I praise the developer for this mechanism as this means that there is no longer a 20-unit doom stack for every 1-province minor factions. (Im sure every player hated this) However it made the game way too easy for me, I had a campaign where i merely need to capture the AI food production towns, the AI never raised another army for 15 turns as they did not have any food producing facilities and towns, there was nothing to do except to siege them one by one after destroying their standing army. 

Secondly, the new province system. The province system are another way that is too dumbed down as well, there are 2 aspect to this. In the building section of the new province system, every small town is no longer customizable, gone are the days in Rome 2 and Attila where you have to plan and strategize which town to upgrade and which facilities to build to manage your limited food supplies. In this game, a town produces what the developers have ''preset'' it produce, this sucks much fun out of the campaign and you merely need to focus on winning battles.

The battle aspect of the towns is even worse, there are no longer ANY garrison in towns. Not even a 3 unit levy we had since Empire: Total War, welcome back the days in Medieval 2 where you had to have garrisons in every important town. In the campaign, you need to have so many generals to protect your small towns, and if you don't, the AI will send it 2-3 units stack to capture your small towns and wreck as much havoc as possible. Furthermore, fighting in towns and garrisoning them no longer have any defenders advantage, most of the buildings in battle are merely place holder, I couldn't even navigate my Calvary through the streets in-between buildings while there are no longer points to defend and its just a Melee fest to see who slaughters whom first. The only advantage that i seem to get with my generals garrisoning towns are the slight boost to unit's Morale.

Thirdly, the Public Order system. Ever since Rome 2 we had a Public Order system that ranged from -100 to 100, this has been changed. Public order is no longer cumulative and now has a negative and positive value in which negative Public Order would give a % that a rebellion will occur, this means you only need to pray to RNJesus that rebellion wont happen. (I had rebellion triggering on as low as 5% and it messed up my economy so quickly) On another note, I do not know if its to simulate Anglo-Saxons unhappiness with the Vikings but 20-30 turns in, rebellions will start popping up against the AI everywhere, and if they captures a town that produces food, the rebel units will spawn recruit even more rebels which the AI cant kill. I ended up fighting more rebels than other factions.

Lastly, the recruient system. I have mixed feelings regarding this aspect, I welcome how new units are raised at around 25% of their numbers as this means that the enemy cant get another 20-stack full units in 3-4 turns, but it triggers me how the recruient is now global and instant after 15 years of playing, I just captured an enemy town deep inside their lands and I can immediately reinforce my weakened 5-units army in a 20-unit army immediately. We don't even have to build training centers anymore as most units are available to you on hand while the rest are ''unlocked'' via technologies.

While there are minor silly stuff such as silly technologies requirement or 0 historical battles. (I enjoyed the historical and quest battle from previous series)

I love Total War, both its historical and fantasy titles and I was looking forward to Thrones of Britannia to quench my thirst for Historical settings and battle. But if you are a long-time Total War fan, DO NOT buy this game as you will be sorely disappointed, you will be better off playing Attila or Rome 2. If you are a new fan however, do not let this game lower your expectation of Total War, this is just a smaller scale version of other Total War games and thus the cheaper price of $40, try playing Attila or Rome 2 or even Medieval 2 and fall in love with Total War via them. I just hope most of the things they implement here are for Total War Saga and wont affect the upcoming Three Kingdoms, I would hate to be disappointed twice in a row.",60967,1691,76561198007201300,4,8.32 hrs

275850,No Man's Sky,7/19/2019,False,"Picked this up during the sale and after spending most of a night playing the game, I can safely say that I do not recommend this game.

The most helpful review right now says that it's wide as the ocean and deep as a swimming pool, and I agree. But ask yourself this: would you really get more enjoyment from an ocean sized swimming pool over a regular sized swimming pool? Because that's exactly the issue with this game. For the most part, once you've explored the first planet, you've explored them all. Everywhere you go you will see different parts of the exact same swimming pool. Oh yes, the other planets will look different visually, and perhaps that's the greatest appeal of No Man's Sky, a visual one. But in my experience, each planet is functionally the same:

1. Some sort of hazard that drains your hazard protection. (Or if the planet lacks a hazard, as is the case with earth like planets, very angry sentinels, which are flying robot enemies on every planet.)
2. Some plant life
3. Some animal life
4. Randomly placed points of interest which are nearly copies of each other

And that's it. Despite being visually different, this is every planet in No Man's Sky. Suffice to say, this makes planet exploration get real boring, real quick. There will be different plants with nondescript names you will never remember, there will be different animals with the exact same behavior and also with nondescript names you will never remember. And there will be sentinels, mindless robot enemies that are for some reason on every planet and are seemingly impossible to defeat. Destroy one and you'll get an alert that more are coming to you and on it will go until you die or run away.

Which brings me to another glaring problem with No Man's Sky, the story. The game seems like it desperately wants to establish a vivid lore with the mysterious sentinels, the different alien species, and all the planets you can visit. But there is none. Absolutely none. The only ""story"" I got in 7 hours was learning different words for the alien language, words that I could then never see the originals of again, only the English translation, and the main quest line, which comprises of a cryptic signal/voice telling you to do things and then you agreeing or deciding not to. For so much to see, No Man's Sky has very little to show.

The aliens are never formally introduced or anything explained about them, other than their language, and they never do anything other than the pirates attempting to steal the 3 carbon you have in your inventory every time you reach space. Their only purpose is to sit in place in their settlements and stations, waiting for you to talk to them so you can either play a guessing game of what they want or offer them valuable resources for a mystery prize.

Heck, even the tutorial, the very thing meant to teach you about the game, is incredibly bare bones and poorly paced. You start dying on a planet and have to rapidly fix your scanner so you can search for hazard protection fuel, except the messages telling you what to do only pop up 10% of the time. The lengthy cinematic intro takes so long that by the time it finishes, you are already at 20% hazard protection.

Overall, No Man's Sky failed to leave a mark on me. After several hours of exploring, running from sentinels, talking to aliens and building my wooden shack in the desert, I honestly cannot remember a single specific detail from my nearly 8 hours of play time. Not one plant, not one animal, not one alien species, not one planet.

Actually, I take that back. There was one rock called Dwartonium. And I only remember that because I misread it as Dwarftonium at first.",35612,1979,76561198043991900,5,7.82 hrs

====================
Purchased Price: $65[spoiler].99 CAD[/spoiler]
Recommended Price: $15-$20
====================
Why I bought the game
====================
I bought this game feeling super-hyped. I was expecting a vampire themed, open-world power festival with stealth elements. A game like Dishonored, Infamous, Prototype, or even Assassin's Creed...only you know, with vampires.

This is NOT that kind of game.

====================
What kind of game is it?
====================
To put it bluntly, this game is a walking simulator focused on listening to characters prattle on about their mundane (and highly-troped) dilemmas. 

Exploration:
There is no open world, you must walk only in the direction the developers wanted you to go in (all other options are barred to you under the guise of ""locked"" doors). You can't jump, you can't shadow-blink to just anywhere, only to specific locations identified by the game. You cannot try to work your way around obstacles or enemies. You will do as the developers say, and you will like it.

Combat:
The combat is lackluster (with few active skills and even less reason to use them). The controls feel unpolished, the camera often faces the wrong way entirely, and the mechanics are never explained. Fortunately, the enemy behaviour is so predictable that you don't even have to think during combat, which is good for those times you have to dodge without the camera letting you see the enemy. To make matters worse, they are easy to cheese, simply walking out of their attack area causes them to slowly waddle back to their starting points, all while you are wailing on their backsides with a butter knife.

Story:
So maybe this isn't a combat oriented game, maybe it's story driven. That would be fine if that's your kind of thing. Unfortunately, if that is your kind of game, you will be bored to tears by the story and the method of telling it. The story is told by having you walk up to every NPC in the game and meticulously exhausting a small set of pre-defined conversations with them. Oh, and the parts you do choose to say, don't always end up being said the way the option is presented to you. You may be able to pick up a little more from collectibles scattered throughout the hallway that is your level progression. The story itself is also mediocre at best. Every character is a trope or stereotype, to the point where it hurts. I actually think Diablo 3 had equal story writing during the Belial and Azmodan arcs.

Graphics:
The graphics aren't bad for a Unreal engine game...if it were about five years older or $40 cheaper. There's screen tearing, low quality models, and ""life-like"" behaviors that make you think everyone is drunk...which would make sense in an Influenza-stricken London, I guess. Don't worry though, you wont have to see the lack of details or ugly models because the game is too dark to make them out anyways. 

====================
Why Didn't I Refund it?
====================
To be honest, I'm more ticked at Steam's policy of not refunding anything you've played for more than 2 hours on this one. Games like this one, which have extremely slow introductions, and a drawn out ""tutorial"" generally eat a lot of that 2 hours up without you experiencing any gameplay. To make matters worse. This game is mostly running around and listening to incessant conversations with other characters, eating up even more of those precious 2 hours. Steam should really allow for about 5-8 hours on these types of game as it takes that long to even understand that the game isn't about to get any better.

If I sound jilted, it's because I am. I kept trying to give the game a chance. Kept telling myself ""maybe once I get passed this introduction part, there will be more combat / more interesting stories / better skills to use / more exploration."" But there wasn't. So now I've paid $65 for a game that I feel would be more appropriately priced at $15-$20, and I can't refund it because I so desperately wanted it to get better. 

====================
My Advice
====================
That's not to say this is a bad game...just a mediocre one, and not worth a AAA pricetag. Who knows, it might be your type of game. If you do decide to try it out, put on a timer for 1.75 hours and if it's not worth $65 to you by then, refund it. It doesn't get better.

So yeah. I hate that I paid $65 for this game.

RESPONSE TO COMMENTERS
[spoiler] Ok, since this has started picking up more steam than expected, I'm going to reply to a few points that have been raised. If I don't reply to yours, tough.

=============
Purchase Details
=============
I live in Canada, I bought the game in Canadian dollars, I bought the game after release, and not on sale. The game cost $65.99 CAD + tax at the time of purchase.

=====================
This Isn't Your First Review
=====================
Ok, so after doing some research and finding out how to view past reviews, I'll admit this point is valid. This wasn't my first review, please forgive me for forgetting about having reviewed some games 2 years ago.

That said, in keeping with my belief for honesty, I will edit the post, but also make it clear what I originally said.

====================================
You Spent X Hours on a Game You Don't Like!
====================================
At this point in time, I have played the game for roughly 5 hours. I have also shown it to 2 friends to see what their reactions were. One of them played for half an hour, looked at me and asked if I seriously paid 65$ for this game. The other played for about 3 hours befoire telling me he thought I paid too much as well, but that it's not a bad game, just not great.

I can't say if, by the time people read this, I'll have played more, given the game a second chance, or shown it to a few more friends. Sorry.

============================================================
You Should Have Known What You Were Buying / It Was Your Fault For Having Expectations
============================================================
Unfortunately, before purchasing the game, I hadn't heard of DONTNOD, or played their previous games. Nor had I seen any advertisements for the game beyond what was put up on steam.

I'm sorry I don't believe in having to do extensive research on a game, or spoiling it by watching let's plays before purchasing. I doubt many of you bother to do the same with other products you buy. But let me know next time you decide to research that carton of milk you buy at the grocery store.

Yes, I will admit that I expected the game to be something it was not. My expectation, however, was only part of the ""negative"" in my negative review. Even for a story-driven game, the story was, to be quite honest, sub-par. As stated in my review, including characters that meet certain tropes to a T does not make a good story. As not stated in my review, the dialogue was boring, and not being sure what your character will actually say does not make for an interesting story (to me anyways).

My impression of what the game was going to be like was based soley on the videos, pictures, and description on Steam. There are others like me. Tough.

=================================================
BONUS - To Those Crticising or Insulting Me and Not My Review
=================================================
I have, in the past, been approached by companies to comment on negative reviews and shut them down. I know this practice exists. I know for some people, it's a job. 

I am not accusing DONTNOD of this.

If your comment has criticism of my review, I appreciate the criticism and will consider it.

If your comment is meant to criticize or insult me, it will be ignored. [/spoiler]",78360,1397,76561198057759500,4,7.78 hrs

I did not enjoy my initial experience and (from what I can see) things have changed, but the game itself hasn't met anything I wanted it to. I recommend you look into various sources before you buy this game.

EDIT: In light of certain comments, let me make a few things clear:

- Yes, I realize this is Early Access. I say so at the very beginning. No, that does not mean a game that is -SELLING- is immune to criticism. Early Access or not, this is a product that people are capable of purchasing. Therefore, we are free to offer our take on whether or not we recommend it -- and I don't.

That being said, to everyone: Please, take my review with a grain of salt. Feel free to investigate anything I say on your own. Make your own conclusions.

- While it looks like my playtime is insufficient to make any judgments on the game, I can assure you the amount of time I spent was enough to confidently state the points I made.

- Given that this is Early Access, this review -MAY- change drastically, or even be removed if the points I had an issue with are fixed/addressed. I'm not here to nab popularity votes or some shit, the only intention of this review is to warn people who are expecting more than this game can currently provide.

- My opinion might differ from yours. Simply pointing out it's an opinion doesn't negate shit. It's entirely possible that you enjoy the game as is, and if you do, more power to you. However, that doesn't mean I am wrong to think otherwise, nor does it mean anyone who agrees is also wrong.

- If a recent patch fixes any of the issues and I haven't adjusted my review, please let me know in a comment. It is possible (and likely) that I am not aware yet.


Original Review Below:

========================================================================


Let me start out by saying that the game isn't bad. It's a great concept, and it looks pretty great. Further, the game is still in Beta, so don't view the game -too- harshly.

But it has a long way to go before it's worth buying.

1. Too much emphasis on PvP, to where ultimately the game feels like a chore to play. It's impossible to rally any sort of human cooperation a majority of the time, which while fine in a game like DayZ, is a serious flaw in a game like Nether (where safe areas have to be defended and survival typically is best in groups). 

I'd suggest making two (or more) seperate teams/groups, of which the player has to choose from on character creation and cannot change unless they rejoin the server. 

One is the ""survivor"" group, in which members of the group cannot hurt other members, and people inside gain exp boost (or some other form of incentive [maybe hunger slows down?]). The other group is the bandits, which is the free-for-all side of the game, offering no incentive beside being able to hunt whoever they want. The two groups should be easily distinguishable. 

2. Safe areas are not safe. People often camp the entrance of a safe haven and shoot anyone approaching. The ideal solution is extending the area of safe havens and giving combat a cooldown (10seconds?) upon exit.

3. The level system feels pointless, as it resets after every death. It should be account bound, much like how gold-items are. Or removed. Either way, as it stands, there is no reason to level up.

4. Collision issues are everywhere. Crouching often gets you stuck on objects, especially while on a roof.

5. Name tags are displayed when you hover over another person, which is a real big issue when trying to hide/avoid other people. This feature should either be removed or it should be changed to only display in extremely close encounters.

These five issues, amongst numerous other glitches (gun delay, scenary bugs, etc), make the game not worthwhile yet. I hope to see these things changed very soon, so that it feels like playing the game is worthwhile.",72221,2249,76561197984598800,40,7.57 hrs
517630,Just Cause 4,2/16/2019,False,"HOLD ON THERE STRANGER, SCROLLING THROUGH THE REVIEWS! HEAR MY WORDS, AND LET ME TELL YOU A TALE: A TALE OF DISAPPOINENT AND ANGER. LEND ME YOUR EARS, AND LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU...

I've played a TON of JC2 and JC3, so I was excited to try Just Cause 4. I saw all the negative reviews, saying how it's trash and all that. But I thought, ""Hey, I'm going to give it a fair shot. I don't really care about graphics, as long as I'm just having fun."" So, I bought it at full price, and booted up the game, excited to cause some delicious mayhem!

I wanted to like this game. I really did! But I did not. NOT AT ALL.

First impressions went something like this: ""Okay cool, bad guy likes weather. Wait, where are my attachable C4's? Maybe I unlock them later. Explosions! Huh. They seem pretty lack-luster. I feel like JC3's were better. Okay, well at least I can shoot these guys up. I'll just find some pistols a second. (20 minutes pass) Are there no PISTOLS? PISTOLS?! Okay, what about grenades?! Please tell me you at least have some dam GRENADES. It's like a staple in ever action game ever. No? *sigh* I'll just continue this boring mission. Wait, where am I going? Oh, okay over there at that tiny marker. I'll just grapple over there and- Woah what? WHAT THE F*CK DID THEY DO TO MY GRAPPLE?  MY BABY! okay, this is fine. I think I can live with this? Now I gotta go meet with some dude and stuff and... what is even going on?! I'll just open my map, and... What. The. F*ck. Is. THIS?! WHAT KIND OF MENU IS THIS? Stay cool. Pretty soon, it'll become natural (it did not btw). Okay, finally. I can customize my grapple. Maybe I can fix it or something. Nope. Alright, well now I can add balloons and stuff. So I have to go to this menu, into that sub-menu, into that tab, into that selection, and then choose the addition, and then choose the specific type of addition (while holding down a key and cycling through them only with another random key) and... these are the worst controls. You know what? IO'm done. I'm F*CKING DONE WITH THIS BS!""
 *closes game and goes into steam to order my refund.

(Also, there are only sport cars on the roads, so it doesn't feel special when you drive one. And, the cars are way too boring. Also, the controls for driving SUCK A*S.)

I should also note that the liberation system that has been some of the best parts of the series is now gone, and replaced with a stupid squad system that you have to earn and unlock, and it's all just very confusing. Trust me.

In summary, this game seemed to say, ""Hey, if we just slap the Just Cause logo onto the front of it, people will buy it! Don't worry too much about gameplay or the fundamental fun parts about the previous games. It's all about that sweet, sweet revenue."" It pays too much attention to the small things like radio songs and customizing how fast a balloon inflates than the basic point of a game. TO HAVE FUN. As I said before, I'm disappointed that I must write this negative review, but it's just a bad game...

585420,Trailmakers,6/20/2018,False,"This game installs Red Shell spyware on your pc without your knowledge. Just In case people aren't aware Red Shell is a spyware that tracks data of your PC and shares it with 3rd parties. This is an absolutely unacceptable proposition. There is no opt out option and at no point do these developers make players aware that they are tracking almost anything you do on your pc.

EDIT: Apparently Red Shell has been removed from Trailmakers as of today. I'm leaving this review up because a breach of trust is a breach of trust. Removing spyware after you've been caught using it does not make you consumer friendly. It's an act of self preservation.

EDIT 2: Yes Trailmakers has become an absolutely fantastic game and is incredibly fun to play with friends but the Red Shell thing happened. In our modern ""nothing is ever forgotten"" internet age these companies need to know that we will remember that they abused our trust. I am not lobbying for anyone to boycott the game but that they should go into it knowing the company they are supporting has done this kind of thing and there are no reasons to believe they won't do it again. If you are comfortable buying the game then do so. If not then do not. My reason for posting about Red Shell was to inform consumers about the issue.

247730,Nether,1/25/2014,False,"First: I'd verify what most people say about the graphics and shooting mechs - they're nice and they work well enough. 
Second. here's how I feel about the overall design of the game:
I'd like my money back at this point. I enjoyed this game for about three hours. I think I was getting lucky. I WAS also very excited about the prospect of completing missions in a survival game. Here are some things that ruined the game after the initial glow wore off. 
1. Big missions seem more or less impossible to beat in games with random marauders running around.
2. Courier missions (sounds fun, right?) End with PCs camping the goal zone. So you run for ~ 15 minutes and get shot. 
3. Camping PCs have crazy/scary equipment that they bought with real money. F@#$ off. Get the F@#$ out of here. Unnacceptable. 
4. Stuff spawns into the world randomly and without logical placement. I realize this is a genre standard - but it is a pathetic genre standard. 
5. The world is too small for the style of gameplay. I saw the whole thing. 
6. The buildings are SO similar that they may as well be proceduraly generated - which would massively improve this game BTW. 
7. Here's an important one that nobody seems to mention - the Nether (monsters) TELEPORT and are UNESCAPABLE. I understand that this may be a clever way to prevent them from glitching but it also randomizes and renders unrealistic combat with them. It is ultimately annoying to fight them as a result. You run backward while they teleport toward you over and over - It's neat that they're dangerous but it is sad that they TELEPORT. 
8. The level system is . . . uninteresting and seems not worth paying attention to. I think it'd be much better to just start everyone out fully leveled because 1. my fat cousin can run farther than my ""survivor"" and 2. My ""survivor"" eats loads more than my fat cousin. WTF. If there MUST be leveling, I'd like it to be under-the-hood pracice based leveling. 
9. Prey or Pray is a dumb slogan - was before I bought - just throwin that in here. Please just stop saying it.  
10. The masks that the serial-killer veteran players wear are. . .juvenile. I wound up hating all of them. In the time I played I remained a noob and the game felt VERY much about vets mercing noobs. To me that seems like a poor design. Noobs dont want to be bullied and vets dont (in most games) enjoy bullying noobs. These guys do it anyway - which makes me hate them. The juvenile masks make me hate them more. I don't want to spend my free time with these people. 

I know the game is in Alpha and that's why I've left out coments on glitches, completion, lame lighting effects and so on. These gripes are deep design issues and. . . well they aint likely to go away. Sorry. 

Here's some things that could improve it for me: 
1. Non PVP server for doing some of those sweet lookin missions. Also a no paid-content option would be nice. I feel like paid add-ons in a PVP game is a bit of a deal breaker for me. 
2. Bigger (Way) map, preferabley proceduraly generated - I know it's too late for that. 
3. More sensible item spawning, perhaps mildly instanced item spawns - i.e. if I'm hurt it'd be nice to find bandages in an ambulance - ever.  I should be able to make logical descisions about where to go for what. 
4. No lame outfits. Lame means - anything 13 year olds think looks cool. Just do a test group and delete everything they like.
5. Some way to punish Vets for mercing noobs. If there is some system for that it isn't working. 
6. Color. The apacolypse will not dull the color of leaves. Leaves will be leaves. Paint will not dull inside away from UV damage. The post-apocolypse will be in full color spectrum color. Please stop this idiotic mistake. Thanks Bethesda. 
7. Make the Nether escapeable. It WOULD be more fun for EVERYONE to be chased by big scary stuff and have to hide.   
8. Make it so players can run. Like a real person can run. Most adults could run across this map in one go at a good clip. It's like four city blocks on the long side. 
9. Get rid of safezones. 
10. Share rewards within vicinity with cooperation thus encouraging teamplay. 
 
Out of 10:
Graphics - 9 <- point off for the lame old post-apocolyptic color pallette blunder. 
Sound - 6 <- good but thin and repetive. 
Community - 2 <- Vets mercing noobs with ""Manhunt"" style Jason masks ruins this game for me. How about some goggles or some scarves or something. . . why phychopathic serial killers? 
Concept - 7 <- In theory this game could be good. In practice most of the ideas aren't realized at all. 
Design -5 <- The monsters are great, the city is pretty good, the People are REALLY lame. (bright green napsacks?) Where are these halloween masks coming from? I actually saw witch hunting hats like the ones from Warhammer 40k. Seriously, they're in there. hahahahaa.
Mechanics - 2 <- Game mechanic integration ruins this game for me. It just isn't fitting all together. Random spawns. There isn't much to do - or you don't get to do it with jerks randomly killing you. 
Fun - 6 at first then on down to 1.

Criteria: [list]
[*] Graphics: 10/10 - Simply Beautiful. Scenery is pleasing. The concept of sunset/calm sea is relaxing. (May not be 10/10 if you've played games in Ultra 4k settings, but from a mid-range spec like me, this is wonderful).
[*] Gameplay: 9/10 - Very Fun, Strategic, Teamwork, a bit repetitive. Objective (most people ignore it, few people actually do it which i put 9/10). Game needs incentive to go to the island, like more points, +15 ticket, or something. Repairs need more optimization (i would repair a spot, but won't register. However, if I'm like behind the cannon, then I can repair.) Spatially speaking, makes no sense.
[*] Computer Hardware: 7/10 - Needs Optimization, PC requirement said i5-2400/fx-6300, but frames still inconsistent (alpha, so fine). Needs some Optimization work, maybe have view distance as part of option to help stabilize Frames.
[*] Cost: 10/10 - for 20 bucks, it's great! Best non-AAA game so far.
[*] Theme: 10/10 - There Arrrggghhhh Too many zombie games, and world war games. Pirate theme is still fun and enjoyable.
[*] Griefing?: 8/10 - There is a vote kick system, so trolls/griefers will be kicked easily. Bad part? If an entire party of friends decides to kick one player to make room for another, that's just votekick abuse.
[*] Gamemodes : N.A./10 - More Gamemodes incoming.

Possible improvements:
[list]
[*] Have customized weapons loadout.
[*] More audio customization.
[*] Rain map needs to be modified so that it doesn't kill frames.
[*] I'd love to see rank modes/competitive modes.
[*] needs crosshair in-game.
[*] Movement mechanics need work.

What an absolute mess of an update. It took 6 years to release and update and during these six years it seems like the developer took out everything from the game that people enjoyed about it and added some things which make you question what the hell he was thinking.

The exp system is gone and has been replaced with item-based progression. That wouldnt be too bad, but he also added region-locking, meaning that when you walk into another zone your gear gets downscaled to trash level gear making it utterly useless. Key items used for travel such as boats, glider and reigns so you can ride your pets are also region-locked and are lost upon leaving the area. 

Continueing on the topic of removal of content and mechanics. The old skill trees that used to be in the game have been removed and instead been replaced with a simple and dumbed down Overwatch-esque skill system. 
Left click being main attacks and doing the least dmg. Richt click being your secondary attack doing more dmg, but needing a resource of some kind. Shift a random ability and R being your ultimate.

With all the region-locking and removal of stuff you might be wondering what the actual progression is supposed to be. Well it's in the form of artifacts. These artifacts provide permanent powerups that are not bound to a certain region and can be used everywhere. Well great! you might say. ""There is a progression after all! I'm gonna get the game now!"".. Stop right there you criminal scum.  I haven't told you yet what upgrades these artifacts give you. And when I do I doubt you'll still want to play.
These artifacts only give secondary travel upgrades. Some examples of these are:
-increased light radius by 0.3
-increased glider speed by 10%
-increased boat speed by 10%
-recuded stamina use while diving

That is all!!!!! These artifacts dont give any meaningful upgrades and are borderline useless. You spend 5-10 hours clearing a zone just to get one of these artifacts that gives you meaningless stuff like +0.3 light radius. You have nothing to show for those 10 hours you spent clearting a zone because as soon as you walk into another zone you might aswell have created a new character.

And im not even going to go into the whole censoring of legitimate criticisms on the steam forums which have been removed by the devs and moderators to remove any ""negativity"" You can check out the subreddit for that mess.

So with all this said. I hope something will change drastically but Wollay (Dev) doesnt have a good track record of communication and updates. So untill it does I cannot recommend this game, I even advise you to stay away from it and waste your money on some other game that doesnt make you feel like a fool for wasting 5-10 hours.",85329,2694,76561198016174100,9,6.90 hrs

At first I was a bit skeptical ... but because of the few euros I thought: come buy, I'll buy the game. Try it because I like horror.
After a few hours of playing this game. I came to the decision: awesome

This game is very good, well developed for an early. Just wow. So much can come of this.

Runs very smoothly/very well optimised.
Rounds are short and snappy.

Extremely tactical.
Excellent destruction ""Realistic"".
Intuitive controls.
Completely unforgiving.
Tailored for all skill levels.

Some collision problems with some of the maps.

The game also has enough meat to it to put all of it's mechanics to good use without ever feeling underplayed or gimmicky. I also feel that the game does a good job of making you care about the main character's well being, he goes through so much crap in this game that it makes it all the more motivating to keep going and see what happens next.

391540,Undertale,1/7/2016,False,"Undertale is an RPG game that takes many clich√© elements in RPG games and creates it into this new type of game in which, just as the description mentions, you do not have to harm a single soul. 

PROS:
+ Unique type of gameplay
+ Battles are unlike anything seen before
+ Surprising elements (planned crashes, (non-harmful) game file issues, etc.)
+ Many different characteristic entities, all with a very unique behavior
+ Intriguing artwork
+ Multiple ""routes"" and endings
+ Great amount of soundtracks
+ Trading cards with valuable crafting rewards

CONS:
- It's not really clear in some battles what you're supposed to do
- The protagonist character is rather bland and randomly constructed. It doesn't feel satisfying to be the ""normal guy"" in what is best described as a world filled with a colorful mismash of vivid characters
- A lot of the game and its areas and transitions make little to no sense
- Not exactly story-driven, despite the title being UnderTALE. Rather a loose collection of character dialogues, jokes and interactions that eventually bring you to the end
- The further you come in the game, the more it devolves into endless dialogues that really make you want to skip them (for example: the part where Alphys just keeps texting you over and over annoyed me greatly)
- You don't do much else than walking around, interacting with characters and having battles

Undertale is a pretty pioneering game when it comes to what we have seen in RPG games already. However, it's not exactly a game for everyone. If the humor didn't catch you, like it didn't with me, chances are you didn't enjoy the game altogether. Despite my generous rating for this game, because I feel that this game is certainly different than your average RPG, I did not enjoy this game a lot because the charm of it simply failed to capture me. Obviously it did click with other people. Even then, I still fail to understand how this game was dominating the gaming market for several months, and seemingly still raging on as I edit this review I typed months ago when the game's afterglow should've ended already.

My rating: 8/10 (read on for more information about this rating. Any more comments about this will get removed)

Edit: I usually don't break character in my reviews, but I want to share a bit of the bad experiences I had with both the game [b]and[/b] the mentality of the fanbase.

I copied and pasted my review back after a mass fanboy downvoting parade flew over it rendering the score below 33%. It's not really fair to sketch my review off as ""not helpful,"" because I give both pros and cons and explain why I don't recommend it. I'm not saying the game is bad or shouldn't be played, but it's not my cup of tea either.
I could also just write an awful joke or reference from the game here, like a lot of people do because the crowd deems it ""hilarious,"" but that isn't helping anyone, but instead deprives people from helpful reviews that [b]do[/b] help them getting an insight of what the game is like. And yet, those are the ones gathering all of the attention and upvotes.

This game enforces some kind of idea that if you don't like the game, you will be found and treated like a heretic and your choice on videogames is suddenly bad. I mean look at the helpful/not helpful ratio of the negative reviews. While most ""singular-line reviews"" in the positive section have a 90+ percentage of being ""helpful"" (read: completely useless), constructively crafted negative reviews kind of get looked down upon. I've seen some well-constructed ""not recommended"" reviews way better than mine being downvoted beyond belief. This kind of inability to witness people disliking something you love arose in some of my (former) friends and makes me feel like this game is mainly played by teenagers or people who find the hype of randomness and memes hilarious and can't at all take any negativity over it. 

Of course, if you don't see yourself in this, you shouldn't feel guilty.
I'm not implying that you shouldn't downvote reviews that aren't going further than a few sentences, nor that you shouldn't voice your opinion over it, but instead encourage you to rate and argumentate fairly and considerate. Feel free to downvote mine too if it didn't give you insight or a different perspective. This is all besides the point of this review, but I'd like to have this addressed nevertheless.

275850,No Man's Sky,8/15/2016,False,"""A mile wide but an inch deep"" was the title of Haedox's review, and a good one sentence summary of No Man's Sky. Since its release on PC, the amount of negative mobilization against the developer has been alarming, and overly harsh. However, behind the slandering and swinging punches there are some basic valid points. Two of which are that is was indeed released too early on PC, and it is overpriced. But for me, neither of these are why I'm not recommending the game at this time. 

The main issue with the game is in its DNA. Whilst being procedural allows for everything to be different, this randomness is still limited by the depth of its algorithms. Visit 1 planet and you've essentially seen all 18 Quintillion - Colours, animations, flora and fauna may be randomized, but it all starts to look roughly the same. You start to see the parameters set by the algorithms - eg. placement of objects and resources, max terrain elevation. And this problem with depth is not just aesthetic, it affects the biological and geographic complexity and interactivity - extreme temperature shifts should be reflected in the flora and fauna, life should spring up around pockets of liquid on barren planets, a two ton dinosaur shouldnt walk on the hind legs of a bird. Whilst randomness may seem like a great way of creating a whole universe, the reality is our own universe is anything but random - rather a series of interconnected and relative processes. This is what makes it interesting to discover, and what is lacking in the NMS approach. 

For a game that relies on exploration as a key motivator to play, I just don't feel like I'm discovering anything spectacular or original. The first three hours of the game were fantastic. Good premise - ship has crashed, needs repair. A new alien world to discover - your time on the first planet is really brilliant - taking in excellent sound design, strange plants, spotting your first creature. However once you arrive at your second, third, and fourth, you start to realise that the game's main incentive - to discover new worlds, simply doesn't hold up under the weight of procedural limitations. 

The interactions with aliens are entertainingly worded, but again, shallow and repetitive, as is resource collection and trade. These galactic duties are perhaps repetitive in reality, true, but where's the sense of danger in walking a few hundred meters to get that mineral, whilst the temperature is dropping 2 degrees a second? Where's the fear when you enter a planet's aosphere, wondering if your ship will hold together? I can't really 'feel' that sense of exploration.

These are my criticisms, and something that I hope can be resolved. Sean Murray had the very best of intentions for our collective experience in NMS, I sincerely believe that. and you can see them throughout his creation - however, I can't help but feel that the game would have been more interesting if it wasn't entirely procedural - A single star system, where getting to your home planet was key - each planet uniquely different, with bordered 'maps' like Destiny, rich with unique plant life and aosphere. As a discovery and exploration game, that would have been incredible. It makes me long to relive that first thrilling walk along the lonely coast of Dear Esther.

So should you buy the game? I will say this, make an assessment based on what I've mentioned in this review, but regardless of your decision, consider that the small team responsible wanted to build the game that WE wanted NMS to be, and perhaps they'll get there. But regardless, respect has to be paid for dreaming and aiming big.",12520,2453,76561198095329000,4,6.23 hrs

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,5/21/2018,True,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.

For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by ‚ÄúFatty G‚Äù(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.

First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent‚Äôs most famous products. (For you guys who don‚Äôt, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I‚Äôd say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.

There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)‚Ä¶As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word ‚Äúmost‚Äù, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what‚Äôs happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.

The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they‚Äôve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You‚Äôve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.

And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don‚Äôt want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.

Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",72709,1598,76561198354182500,29,6.22 hrs

Our multiplayer group has managed to download the game with various download speeds over the span of 2 weeks since purchasing it, this is already a hefty penalty upon ""enjoyment"" but nothing out of the ordinary these days. Combine the fact of slow internet speeds and waiting time to organize a gaming night, now if you were to transfer the game files from one user who has paid the for the game to another user who has paid for the game, for a faster installation experience (opposed to waiting a week) and low and behold, DENUVO DRM in its great wisdom has flagged YOUR game in YOUR steam library as unlaunchable for a period of time.

Go to planet, shoot whatever you can, collect same cr...minerals, use those to craft items to fuel your ship/tool, go to planet. RINSE AND REPEAT.

I know I got the game at full price, but we all make mistakes. For those who haven't purchased this junk, I suggest you spend that cash on something else. This is a game that will go on sale for less than 20 in 3rd party websites pretty soon no doubt. Get it then.

Now the game does have some good aspects, but the bad overcome the good by a large margin.

Good:

+ Lots of farming (if you are into it)
+ Upgrade tools or buy/trade new ships
+ Procedurally generated retarded looking animals
+ Trading system of some sort

BAD:
- Lots of ""I've seen this type of planet for the 100th time already"" planets to explore
- Boring planets that are void of intelligent alien life forms
- Interaction with few aliens found are boring and very short
- Trade system is weak in its overall setup (be it trade of ships or items)
- No story
- Star map has poor navigation system that does not show where you came from, where you are going, what system it falls under and so on and so forth. A good example of such can be found, for comparison, in Elite Dangerous.
- Space combat is boring and beyond arcady. Aospheric flight is not full of freedom as the AI ""holds your hand"" in specific maneuvers
- The entire universe feels dead compared to other space sim/rpg games out there. I thought Elite Dangerous was boring, but I changed my mind after playing this.

The list can go on. You are welcome to check youtube or steam for detailed reviews. 
The game could've been better but considering the contents it delivers, it is no where near a $60 AAA game. At best it is a generic one and fails to do what previous many games already did better.

814380,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,4/11/2019,False,"I wish there was a ""It really is great, but not for me"" button.

Being a fan of the Souls games as well as Bloodborne, I found myself in familiar territory with Sekiro, but something just wasn't quite clicking. All the new systems function well, and the setting is expertly crafted, but it's the stripped away RPG elements that leave me feeling empty with Sekiro. For me, so much of the enjoyment of the Soulsborne games came from exploring the intricately designed areas and finding strange little nooks and crannies containing unique weapons and/or armor. It felt like an interesting and satisfying reward for exploration. In Sekiro, every item you find in the world is more or less a consumable (with few exceptions), and that sense of wonderment feels lost. I feel no desire to explore secondary paths knowing that they all end in yet another pocketful of confetti. That sense that each pathway could potentially result in a weapon that changes your whole playstyle (if you want it to) is no longer present. 

This drawback also bleeds into my second issue with Sekiro: Being locked into a singular playstyle. Again, to reference the Soulsborne franchise, FromSoft games have always come with a variety of ways to build your character. Do you want to be a heavily armored brute with a two handed axe? Have at it. Want to be a robe-wearing mage? Go nuts. How about a holy Paladin type that hurls lightning-spears from behind a shield? Whatever floats your boat. On the flip side, Sekiro takes the approach of ""learn the new parry/block system or die."" Without having the previous FromSoft titles as reference, this isn't a bad thing in and of itself. The system works well and has a good deal of polish; it's the fact that it represents yet another facet of RPG-oriented gameplay that has been stripped away from FromSoft's design philosophy.

The world itself also feels much more linear than that of the Soulsborne titles. To compare Sekiro to Bloodborne or Dark Souls, it's clear that FromSoft was less interested in the intricate world building they're so well known for. The levels are gorgeous and well crafted, but are much simpler and straight forward. The lore is not nearly as cryptic and expansive, and the host of characters are far less enigmatic. Again, not an objectively negative trait, just... Not what I admire about FromSoft titles.

In a vacuum, this game is fantastic on a technical level. In the scope of FromSoft's catalogue, it's a shift away from what I love most in their games.",67133,1282,76561198014250400,6,5.78 hrs
297130,Titan Souls,4/15/2015,False,"This game feels more like a proof of concept rather than a full game. The game only contains bosses which makes it feel like a boss rush version of zelda with the difficultly setting turned up. 

Titan souls has amazing boss designs and themes. The OST is relaxing while tense at the right moments and a decent background noise to your conquest. The combat is straight forward and punishing for any mistakes. 

However this is in constrast with the overworld. There are only two or three spots where you need to interact with the overworld to find a boss (one of which being figuring out the map layout aka Zelda lost woods puzzle). There are a few ""hidden"" pathways that lead to shortcuts or hidden artwork. The game gives you zero reason to ever backtrack to an area so once you've finished killing the areas bosses which range from 2-3 in an area you never revisit the area. 

There are only a few mechanics in the actual gameplay. Only a few bosses need to be killed in a special way while the rest are shoot in the butt/eye. 

I would gladly pay 60$ for fleshed out version that contained actual puzzles, overworld enemies and powerups. Currently it only took me 3ish hours to complete and I don't feel inclined to replay using any of the extra modifiers.

Pros:

The graphics are nicely stylised, and run smoothly.
The funniest tutorial I've played in a game so far.
Great for having some friends around, as the learning curve isn't that steep.
It's a bit like a multiplayer hotline miami, with more to do than just killing (although that always an option).
It's still in early access, the dev is very active and is constantly fixing bugs and adding new features.
There is already plenty of content and unlockable characters - each with their own traits/buffs/neuroticisms.
The sim aspect is coming along nicely, interactables work well, NPC's reactions are amusing and well thought out.
Online multiplayer (haven't tried this yet)
Can press enter to chat, would press enter to chat to my friend sat next to me again.
Generative levels are done well.

Cons:

Split screen functionality, can sometimes be confusing, especially when bringing up the map, which covers the whole screen, gets cluttered with 4 people + inventory (quick use commands were not working in multiplayer in alpha 25).
Narrative between levels would be a great addition, especially since it has a classic arcade machine intro.
Plenty of bugs, needs more content, but EA so to be expected.
No FBI loading screen, telling people that ""Winners don't use drugs""

275850,No Man's Sky,7/1/2018,False,"One year and 11 months after launch, No Man's Sky has gotten a bit better. However, I still cannot recommend this game. It retains the same identity of ""wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle"" and fails to provide a satisifying experience to the player.

I bought No Man's Sky for the PS4 back when it released. I can't believe I spent $60 back then for an unfinished game. It also doesn't make sense to buy it for $30 now. Twenty dollars or lower would be a much better price for this game, because it can keep you occupied for a good bit of hours, but it won't make you entertained. I unfortunatly bought it for $35 for the sale last summer. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. 

The technical feats of the game are interesting (18 quintillion planets, probably around a quintillion some systems, and unique plants and animals for each planet) but don't give the game any more substance because the majority of the game has you do the same thing: fly to a planet, take the minerals, go to another planet, mine it, and go to another galaxy, with a  miniscule amount of story involved. 

The soundtrack and graphics are pretty, though. The graphics aren't necessarily ""realistic"" but have their own unique style.

The main purpose of this review to inform people before they make the mistake of shelling out $30 for this like I did. Trust me, you are not missing much. It is a boring game that gets repetitive after a few hours. Give it another year and wait for it to be $15 or $20, then maybe its worth it.

They did a good job on the base game mechanics with the AI and cutscenes but thats where it stops.  They even managed to ruin and defame one of the most iconic battles in history. you breach the beaches of normandy in barely over a minute(and by breaching i mean you run straight to the wire and quickly blow it with a bangalore which is set of by a clacker lol and you are less than 15 feet from it with absolutley no cover).  there is very little historical scenery and you got Germans running out of bunkers with ppsh41s, a Russian SMG that was NEVER used by the Germans at any point, especially D-Day.  Censorship of historical material such as the SS uniforms....arm bands were wiped of the Nazi Party emblem and replaced by some garbage. and I could go on about that as well.  Multiplayer the weapons has reflex sights.....like wtf I guess the germans had modern tech back in the day as well as shotguns with incendiary rounds and acogs for sniper rifles.  Servers are shit.  They cadered to the typical COD playstyle of quick scoping and other nefarious and annoying practices.  But the Up front, bottom line here is that They advertised a WW2 era game. not a typical COD FPS with the theme of WW2. there is a difference and I feel as if I had a fast one pulled on me.  I left COD after Ghosts becuase the direction they went in wasnt one I was willing to go. If i wanted futuristic Id play Halo or Destiny.  I bought this game becuase I though COD was legitimately going back to its roots not making false claims to get a temporary boost in purchases.  So if you Like traditional COD games where you can quickscope, get cool attachments and power-ups and prestige then man this is your game.

EDIT: Since this blew up, lemme save some of you time. If you want to support the devs or to tell them that they should release the rest of the series here, you do you. IMHO they'll make a bank regardless, and buying the deluxe tells them that it's acceptable to half-ass soundtracks. If you don't care about audio quality, move along.

272270,Torment: Tides of Numenera,3/1/2017,False,"I was very excited for this game when the kickstarter was announced (4 years ago!!!) and backed it for $250 dollars.  I have been playing isometric crpgs since the 90s, and have always loved games like Baldur's Gate 1&2, Icewind Dale 1&2, and of course Planescape: Torment, the game that originally inspired this one. 

This review is both a commentary on the game itself, as well as inExile as a company.  First, to inExile - you can skip a few paragraphs below if you're just interested in the game. In 2013, inExile was happy to take backers money to make this game, and slated the delivery for T:ToN in December of 2014.  They made about four times as much money as they set their funding goal at, and as stretch goals made many promises about added content to their backers.  Ultimately, it seems that many of those promises have not been kept, which is disappointing, but forgivable if the game is well-made at the end of that process and the company is communicative with the people who helped to fund the project. 

However, after the kickstarter funded and pledges from people like me were locked in, inExile announced that they were changing the combat system from Real-time-with-pause (RTwP) to Turn-based (TB) mechanics.  They announced that this was to better fit the mood of the game.  That claim is very dubious, as the 90s game that they are basing this sequel off of (Planescape: Torment) has a RTwP combat system.  ""What can change the nature of a game?""  Well, an obvious answer would be to change one of the fundamental mechanics of the game.  Personally, I would never have donated money to inExile for Torment had I known they were planning to make a TB game.  

But why would inExile make such a fundamental change for a fan-funded game that so many people felt so passionately about?  At first, this was not obvious, and it really wasn't until the game was coming close to release that I really understood.  From a business standpoint, RTwP combat-based games have one major issue.  They require a mouse and keyboard, and are therefore mostly a PC-friendly market.  TB games, on the other hand, are easily adaptable to controller-based game play and have a wider distribution on consoles.   Since inExile is releasing XBox ONE and PS4 adaptations of this game, it is fair to say that they chose to screw their fan-funders for a market friendly combat system.  

Adaptations to new systems cost money, and so it is even more frustrating to find that inExile has cut a massive amount of content from this game that was promised during the fund-raising phase on kickstarter.  Over a four year development cycle, they made no announcements to their backers about cut content, even though it is now clear that they spent a lot of that money that was supposed to be used to create that content on console ports, and actually only let backers know that anything had changed in the game about a month before the game released. The cut content included promised characters, an entire city, and while I personally have not finished it, reports indicate that the game is relatively short for a crpg.  During that time without communication to their fans about the dropped content, inExile raised millions of dollars from two other crowd-funded projects - Bard's Tale IV and Wasteland 3.  In addition to cuts from the game, inExile also gave a worse deal to fans who purchased a collectors edition during the kickstarter than those who purchased it at release, and also cut a promised Italian localization in order to ship this game to consoles.  

Game Review:

Story 9/10: This is where this game shines - it is well written and the interactions between objects/characters in the game is fascinating.  In places it is badly in need of an editor, but after playing for about 5 hours, it is clear that the game story lives up to - but does not surpass - the game that it is trying to emulate.  The protagonist is not as well characterized as the Nameless One from PS:T, which detracts from the immersion. The major focus of this game is to tell a unique, strange story in as much depth as it can, and it succeeds in keeping your interest.  If you like to read, 95% of the game play is reading text in the vein of a choose your own adventure novel. Well done here. 

Graphics/Interface 5/10:  There is no way to change how fast the interface moves with a mouse scroll - presumably because the game has been adapted for console-controller play.  This is inexcusable, as the game is run on the Pillars of Eternity engine, a game that was released in 2015, and that game had the option to adjust the mouse scroll.  The 2D backgrounds are beautiful, the character models and animations are not.  Character's momentum/inertia during movement is incredibly distracting, and the strange need for the camera to follow your character is very odd for this style of game.  Altogether, these things add up to a very frustrating interface that slows the pace of the game down.  For a game with a 4 year development cycle, it feels like I am playing an alpha build.  

Combat 2/10:  Even for a TB game, the combat mechanics are incredibly weak.  Divinity OS, which I played for a very short amount of time, had an excellent TB system that used action points to define your movement and abilities.  You could do anything in any order, so long as you had sufficient AP to perform the task.  Torment uses a simplified mechanic where each character gets one movement and one action.  When you choose an action, or move your character, there is no way to confirm it or take it back, so if you misclick, you are screwed.  By modern standards, this is just pathetic.  Additionally, in virtually every combat you will find yourself highly outnumbered, and this is the game's way of telling you that you should just settle everything with conversations.  If you do find yourself in combat, you need to win on the first round, as the enemies will simply target your protagonist on their first available turn and kill him/her, sending you to the mind labyrinth.  Additionally, because combat is fairly rare, you will most likely have no idea how to use your abilties to their full effect.  This is incredibly disappointing, as the other crpg revival game that is currently on the market, Pillars of Eternity, has a very innovative RTwP combat system that is a true spiritual successor to other isometric RPG games. My other personal beef with TB-combat is that it is SOO SLOOOW!!  RTwP battles can be finished in just a few minutes, even when the combat is challenging.  TB always takes considerably more time, even for trivial battles.  Torment is no exception to that rule.  

Torment is not a bad game, but it doesn't feel like it is a finished game.  It would be an excellent game if it had been released 20 years ago, but compared to all of the other crpg nostalgia releases that have come out over the past five years, it is one of the weaker ones.  This is many due to clunky interface, and poor combat mechanics.  I'm very disappointed that inExile chose to enhance their distribution instead of trying to stay true to what their fans wanted.  This half-baked game is the result.  I will not be supporting them in the future.",38651,1318,76561198084856700,1,5.23 hrs
275850,No Man's Sky,8/15/2019,False,"Edit: Any additional hours past 20 are because of the sunken cost fallacy in effect.

Despite tossing more things into this game I feel like they haven't actually addressed any of the game design problems. The gameplay loop is so boring and untouched since the game launched. You're still just wandering around mining resources to upgrade yourself to mine resources a little faster. Vets will tell you that you can do other stuff but once you do any of those things (bounty hunting, farming, freightering etc.) once or twice you've seen the extent to all it will ever offer you. Hell, bounty hunting seemed fun until the game kept bugging out and wasn't paying me 90% of the time. Turns out that bug has been here for almost a year now so I doubt that will get fixed.

I feel like I am doing a bunch of side activities alongside a bigger game but I'm not, I don't get the point in building a base and the ingame tutorial for the base builder didn't seem to know either. ""Build a shelter to recharge your suit and escape the hazards"" but so does your starship that I can bring with me anywhere. I am constantly hoping the game is about to pull open a curtain to reveal the point to me.

Their is no depth to anything, don't have to worry about keeping your base full of oxygen or sealed off completely, don't worry about medicine, don't worry about food/water, don't worry about any actual hazards you can't ignore completely. The base isn't practical like subnautica where you recharge batteries, generate medkits or do all your crafting, it's just a thing you can do if you feel like it. I thought it'd be good for storage but the massive storage crates only have FIVE inventory slots total and they need to be powered. And everyone mentioning how bad inventory management is aren't kidding around, it's about as tedious as it gets.

The game has basically 0 lore or fun text to read, I'll scan plants and animals hoping to get even a brief description to read to help me get into it but I get nothing except some stats about diet and behavior and the AI doesn't reflect any of this. The AI just wanders around, they don't seem to have a nest, go hunt or do anything interesting. Creatures don't even react to the extreme weather conditions either. I also tried reading through the various upgrades and materials hoping for more context to how everything works (nerdy flavortext is great) but most just give you a description that tells you what to do with this material next. How exciting.

The story just isn't grabbing me even after getting a good decent chunk into it, I feel like it did an absolutely poor job at hooking players early and gates things from the player like exocraft, so you HAVE to follow it. All I can say is that it involves prophecy, memory loss and all that other stuff that hasn't been done to death in other media.

Exploration is what you expect from a computer generated world. You will find repeat flora/fauna fairly quickly (after 1 dozen planets I started noticing) and then you start questioning why this or that works the way it does on this kind of planet. This one annoying plant when you walk past will expand out into a bulb and explode radiation nearby, I keep finding this same plant on volcanic/winter/temperate/desolate/toxic but with a different paint job. 

And I'm wondering how this plant is able to even survive all these extreme conditions even though the game tries to tell me they are all different. This reflects all aspects of the wildlife and plantlife. Seemingly no effort was put into limiting what would appear based on the kind of planet it would be. You'd think bulkier and hairer creatures would lurk where it's -70F but instead I see the same scaley reptile creature wandering in circles that I saw roaming on the volcanic world.

Youdon't come across NPC towns, colonized planets or any more elaborate encounters. I thought it'd be cool to see a sprawling city, 2 tribal factions fighting it out and being able to help one or the other, kill both or find a solution or even introduce them to space travel. Maybe NPCs mining somewhere and helping them out for some quick cash. Literally anything to make the universe look like it is lived in and doesn't revolve around my character. Instead you get the same 1 or 2 structures.

I just want some friggin conflict or obstacle to overcome that isn't grinding resources, let me be in danger, let me be close to death, let me get lost, let me be unwelcomed somewhere, let me experience any thrill. I can't even crash into asteroids or the planet. 

On the technical front my RTX 2060 is maxed out on usage and barely holds 60FPS on max settings 1080P, paired with an i7-8700/16GB RAM and on an SSD, The game needs to increase the LOD for objects because the pop in for asteroids, plants and trees is absurdly close, especially the asteroids. On max textures you'll be dealing with blurry textures popping in and out randomly, you'll see various shaders broken like moving lights on reflective surfaces, your game is going to crash, parts of space stations won't load in so you have to restart and other times I leave a space station and the game tosses me in space with no HUD, ship or anything, forcing ANOTHER restart. This is absolutely unacceptable 3 years after release. Also I am pretty sure the game has a memory leak, a few hour play session played progressively worse until it crashed, then the framedrops I had went away for awhile. 

I feel like doing incredibly basic tasks requires more work in the UI than it really should. And even after a few hours in a session I was still getting lost and having to put a lot of mental work towards doing basic things like crafting or refueling. Other things aren't explained, like what the hell is the technology tab for? I thought in order to use anything in your suit you had to have it there but turns out you don't, can have your equipment and upgrades anywhere. They also don't work if they aren't adjacent. So A+ on that tutorial. Doing basic things that require 1 button press in other games require multiple in this game. Turning on a flash light requires 3 presses on your keyboard and I think 4 presses to change your perspective from 3rd to 1st person. 

It's up to the game to push new players into the right direction and to introduce us to the various ways to play it, it should not be the players going the extra mile to dig up excitement in the game or vets telling people they are playing it wrong or it isn't there type of game and shouldn't criticize it. 

I don't think the game has improved much since launch since at the end of the day you aren't being challenged and you aren't playing Minecraft where you can take a step back and admire a creation. Little over 10 hours in and I pimped out a new multi tool, upgraded my ship, made 3 bases and own a Frigate. But I feel like none of it was earned, none of it was fun to get and ultimately I feel like this game is only getting my playtime because I am desperate to not have wasted $30 because of the small 2 hour refund window.

Some other annoyances real quick, talking to NPCs opens up a text prompt that you can't skip through and the text appears slowly. Talking to a navigator requires you to keep reopening chat over and over to sell him 1 navigational pad at a time which add up if you explore a lot. You also can't build or design any ships, you can't even customize the appearance of your ships. The game is also badly in need of an autowalk hotkey, but they'd make it require 5 button presses and a summoning to use it I'm sure.

I fully do not recommend this game until they change up the gameplay, fix the gamebreaking bugs and flesh out the early game for new players to get into it better. It'll take a lot more than making that ocean wider to make it deeper, you're gonna have to start digging into it a bit devs.",16858,1013,76561198064762900,23,5.22 hrs

From what I'd heard you just sit at a border checkpoint and decide if people are allowed to enter the country or not. And that's exactly what I got, but Papers, Please is so much more than that. It's not just a job simulation, it's a story of moral choices and corrupt government. It's not just about a border guard, it's about a man who struggles to provide for his family, who must work for the smallest of wages to make some of the toughest choices. You sit in your little checkpoint booth. A man comes up and hands you his passport. You skim over the information and stamp a big green ""APPROVED"" for him. He thanks you and starts to walk away, but before he does he says, ""my wife is right behind me, please be nice to her."" Sure enough, up steps a nice young woman. There's her passport. You look down and see an expiration date of last month. ""This document is expired"" you say. She stares at you, eyes wide and pleading: ""Please, if I go back to my country they will kill me. Please let me in."" What do you do? Do you risk losing your paycheck and therefore leave yourself unable to buy medicine for your sick son? Or do you abandon all morality and turn the woman away?

After spending a game in the Multiplayer and in Zombies, I can safely say this is Call of Duty. If you're a FAN, then that is absolutely fine, there is a decently sized content package here for you. I, however, have been playing Titanfall 2 over the last few days and the transition is crazy. This game feels much more sluggish than Titanfall 2, which is weird because they try to go for the same fluid gameplay.

The actual content itself is just a bore too. If you're a CoD fan, go for it. If not, man just don't bother, it's not worth the gamble with the price.

Unfortunately, I don't feel this game has aged very well, with the gameplay feeling very basic in comparison to modern shooters.

Got out of the plane and ran away as quickly as I could(first time I played they attacked the plane like 3 minutes in the game) So I figured they were attracted by the crash. 

Found a quiet place, I built a shelter and made a fire. Cooked a rabbit, but it started raining so I couldn't keep the fire up, so I found some berries and luckely, they were not poisenous. 

Went to sleep woke up early morning and there was 3 naked guys stalking me outside, they attacked me and I ended up slaying all of them. I built one statue with their heads and legs.

Later in the morning, 3 other naked guys came near my shelter, I burned the statue and they ran away. They came back 5 minutes later with 3 more. I couldn't handle their attacks, so they kidnapped me. I woke up in a dark cave with only a lighter to show me the way. I heared a distant shouting that scared the living crap out of me and I saw about 30 passengers hanged upside down above me.

I tried to find my way out of the cave, I almost couldn't see anything and I could hear them, I know they were watching me. Then after a lot of stress and sweating, I found the exit. I was so glad to finally see the sun, then some extremelly weird texture rendering just started spawning trees, flowers and life in front of me. 

Then went on a run trying to find my shelter but I was very low health. Got cold. I got jumped on by a naked girl who were on top of a tree. She took me by surprise, I shouted in real life, I saw my cat running out of the room scared of me.

Finally, I take a close look at the naked girl just before she gives me the final blow, the last comment I have before to die: '' Hey!!! I can see her tities''.

Food, water, and oxygen deplete quickly. As in, you have to make sure you get your 10 square meals a day and refill your oxygen partially every few minutes, spending the points you need to level up. Most of the map is covered in the dust, and you have to 'discover' it by exploring-- except you can't put markers down at all, even to the places you've been before. You can't boil clean water to prevent puking until chapter seven. Crafting recipes are trickled out incredibly slowly, and the game actually expects you to manage hordes of zombies with basic melee weapons and basic fences for a frustratingly long time.

In a nut-shell, I really love this game, here's my experience, spoiler free so far:

The first 10 seconds were breathtaking, literally. I've been playing VR since 2018, a lot of games, and while the first moments of it were amazing, the feeling of presence went down a bit as I went along, playing more games. But this, this is something else. The attention to detail is amazing.

Performance is fantastic, I don't really know how they manage to pull that quality and achieve steady 90 fps. That's a technical achievement for sure.

As for world interaction / controls, they are the best they can possible be. I've played Boneworks and having physics everywhere is kinda interesting, but just as a concept. Going up a ladder in Boneworks or climbing was awful. The rest was good.
HL:A merges the best of two worlds. There's physical interactions for moments where they are needed, but they won't get in your way at all. And I really love that, because is just a frigging game, not a simulation. For example, going up a ladder here, is simple. Opening a door too. It won't get smashed in your face, only features necessary collisions. Also I really love how they went all in and gave physic properties to some enemies. That increases immersion by tons!

The hacking puzzles, I had my expectations low, but oh boy, I was really wrong. They are quite fun to do, they are challenging but not tiresome. They provide random patterns so the challenge always stay fresh.

The sounds are amazing, I had to take my helmet because I thought a rat came into my room. Then I thought it was a faulty hard disk. Nope. It was the game. I believe the sound experiments they did with CS:GO carried over here and it really shows. Character voices were a bit loud tho.

The Half-Life winks are amazing. And for someone who played them all, spent 10 years making a HL mod and basically kickstart a game dev career, it was tear inducing.

My only complain is the ammo system. While I love the Tresspasser reference (""Two mags left!"") I really wish I could store back some pistol ammo. I thought that was going to bit a bit more arcade-y, but it's okay, it really helps to build up some tension.

I was going to try the game for a bit, ended up playing like 5 hours straight. Couldn't really put it down.

The upgrade system is a nice addition. Also for the different enemy types. 

It's an evolved Half-Life in every way, and is what I expected and much much more.

Now, I will get a bit sad for other companies, because they set the bar incredibly high.

AAA VR games will be like this, or better, and can't say how really happy that makes me.

I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys :D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot-on-sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. 

All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",43161,11303,76561197970179400,3,4.62 hrs

285190,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III",7/22/2017,False,"Well well, here we are, another entry into the DoW franchise. I excitedly bought it after they bragged about how they brought base building back, which was a huge complaint with the second iteration. Naturally this was a huge deal for me as a DoW fan boy since the beta of the first, but boy was I surprised when I played a skirmish.

Lets start with the pros.

[list]
[*] [b] Beautiful graphics [/b]
The graphics in this game are top notch, details that were not included prior are now shown in beautiful effects, going from the shine from metal surfaces to particle effects.

[*] [b]  Army Painter [/b]
It returns and it returns just as good as its previous iterations with more options, more options in this case just makes it better.

[*] [b] Unit Design [/b]
Unit design is really neat, including huge scaled up ones at a more appropriate level than previous DoW games. The ones we know and love return, and there are some new ones to spice up the mix. Their abilities are satisfying and are scaled properly for the power they should have, such as tanks or large walkers.
[/list]

Now I know there isnt a lot of pros, and well, thats reflective of my overall review. Lets hop into the Cons.

[list]
[*] [b] Cover System [/b]
This feature is all but destroyed. Its been scaled back to the point that you sit in little shielded domes instead of sandbags and things that are more lore friendly. It makes no sense at all. Also, overall there are VERY FEW of them, which makes choke points pretty much not viable at least to the degree youd expect. 

[*] [b] Map Design [/b]
Map design has been simplified to the point where it feels like a really bad MOBA, All we are missing is the creeps. MOBAs arent really a bad thing but the end result is half baked between the two.

[*] [b] Campaign Mode [/b]
Honestly, I dont even know why they even included one. This is a complete waste of time that reflects in no way and is just a linear path of creep killing ala a MOBA. There is little detail, little overall effort put into this, and it shows. It was brutal for me to play, because of how it went from DOW1 to this.

[*] [b] Lack of players [/b]
Multiplayer is pretty dead. I waited in a queue for ten minutes for 3v3/2v2 and got no match. Is this game already dead? Probably. 

[*] [b] Uninteresting storyline [/b]
Sort of a continuation of the campaign bulletpoint, but the story is the most uninteresting by far, which while DOW2 wasnt a emmy winner, it was pretty interesting for your standard RTS faire.

[*] [b] Lack of depth to combat [/b]
This is alien to the franchise but overall the game feels like it feels like its lots its depth, and combat feels more like a grinding match as to whom can pump out the most res and therefore pump out the most units to win. Theres no rear or side armor damage bonuses, no cover in 99% of combat. Literally the only thing you can do to affect outcome is place abilities well, but even then it just puts your hero at risk in most cases. Combat ends up feeling shallow as a result
[/list]

[b] Review Summary [/b]
I really hate to give this game a no for recommendation because I really love Dawn of war. Unfortunately this game really struggles with a identity crisis that fleshes out neither side of a RTS and MOBA. Honestly this is a huge mistake on the marketing/director of development, as this game clearly identifies a very large oversight in a attempt to cover two bases and sell more product.

Ultimately this leads to a massive failure to make good on their promises and leaves the game as a dumpster fire as I am almost sure the poor sales will lead to the demise of this franchise, when instead they should have forked a MOBA into its own franchise and kept the RTS just that, an RTS. This is no surprise given the cash shop approach that they gave COH2, which surprise, also had not stellar sales. Someone in charge is putting these games in a shallow grave design wise, which is unfortunate. Oh well.

-No, you cannot skip the cutscenes.  You WILL have feels for these characters, you WILL (but probably not because they're all lacking depth).*

A car chase, okay... pretty sure you've done this before, COD, but this works.  Sneaking around a German compound, sweet!  Finally something... oh he saw me?  Wearing this German uniform, he saw me and is apparently upset about this.  Meanwhile all of his buddies are having conversations without actually moving their mouths or talking, that's cool Activision, I'll go elsewhere to fulfill my attention to detail.  A flying mission, sweet.  DEFINITELY did this one in one of the earlier Call of Duty games, but hey, we're repeating everything, so why skip this one.
-Physics.  Did we forget this was a thing?  I just watched a Stuka divebomb a tank and pull a 270 up in a matter of maybe 10 meters.  I can hop for days, and hop I will, because...

-Okay, I'm a huge fan of games that people die when you shoot them, maybe I'll give Hardcore a try...  M1Garand shot, center mass, no kill, he returns fire with a pistol, instant kill at 20 meters.
-Kill cam.  Watch it, watch the muzzle of the weapons jump, but the bullets go straight.  Just watch it.
-All gripes and complaints aside, this game is an AMAZING... airsoft simulator.

ZOMBIES
-look awesome, now we know where all the dev's time went. **
-It's Nazi zombies... did you expect differently?  There's some new zeds, bombs and fire and stuff.  1 map, hope you like it. 
-Honestly thought it was good my first run through.  Prologue was cool, read reviews about it being more linear and adventure-y, but once you've opened all the gates, it's a circle map with the old tried and true tactics every game.  Not my flavor, but a solid improvement still.


Here's to getting TBagged by that black female German with an American helmet using a Russian PPSH in Gibraltar.

While I think people are being hyperbolic about comparing this to a PS2 game there are definetly things that remind me of mid gen PS3 / 360 titles in a non-flattering way. 

Just Cause 3 had it's performance issues on console but it's an otherwise beautiful and vibrant game. Just Cause 4 feels like a B team took on what Just Cause 3 accomplished. It's hard to feel like this is just a bug when the game launched this way and everyone is seeing the same things. Including console players who should have builds locked to specific hardware specs.

Outside of the graphics this game is just a terrible port in general. The WASD keys can't be remapped and the Menu itself is simply awful. You can click on items in the graphics settings with no feedback that anything has actually changed and an apply button that seemingly doesn't work. Pressing escape does nothing in half the menus to bring you back (It's all bound to right mouse which is not communicated at all) and left clicking on the back button does not in fact bring you back to the previous menu. It's like no one even tested this stuff with a mouse / keyboard.

The most unforgivable part of the port. It crashes constantly. I had the game crash 7-8 times on me in the hour I spent with it. It wouldn't even launch for me until some significant forum searching where someone suggesting turning off steam cloud saves which worked for some reason.",85460,1205,76561197966738500,7,3.85 hrs

The biggest issue is that, compared to previous X games and every other space game, there is simply nothing to do at all. Every feature of this game is a boring time sink - you walk around stations for no particular reason, to find copy-pasted people who serve no real purpose, to aid you in your quest to fly your one solitary ship that isn't in any way fun to pilot. Everything is a chore to do once and then tiresome to have to repeat again and again. The terrible interface doesn't help either, with you and your poor idiotic co-pilot spinning around in your seats trying to figure out the useless map system.

More of an emotional review

[spoiler] It's amazing how this game went from a tropey dating sim to meta horror to a surprisingly heartwarming ending, especially with the golden ending. I went in expecting to get spooked. What I didn't expect was to actually feel for these characters, who only ever scared you because of the machinations of a sympathetic villain.

More than anything, this game made me sad. I think that's what the creator intended. We're presented with this cliche dating sim harem scenario, a perfect example of male wish fulfilment. However, despite some pretty generic character archetypes, I still found them more and more compelling as I spent time with them and discovered the drama they were concealing.

Then just as you're getting comfortable, the twist in tone you always expected finally arrives, and yes, it's unsettling and creepy and may even make you jump, but it doesn't stop giving you something to engage with beyond the sheer shock value of those scares. And when we learn the truth behind the horror, we realize it was never really a horror game, but a dating sim turned on its head by an AI painfully aware of the outside world.

It's hard to pin down exactly how it's made me feel. I was left with this unfilled yearning for the sort of interpersonal drama and growth the game teased in its first two acts. I guess what resonated most with me is that this sort of synthetic, yet beautiful interpersonal scenario can only exist in a simulated environment. It's meant to be tantalizing, it's meant to play on your desires, but if the characters were to ever become aware of the reality of their existence, they'd be shaken to their cores.

But this is less about the experience of those characters, considering the actual AI in this game is nowhere near complex enough to produce self-awareness. It's what those characters show us about the boundaries between us and our beloved simulations that really matters. It shows us not only yearning for something more than we can experience in our day-to-day lives, but being discontent with the very fabric of our reality. 

And maybe that really is still a kind of horror. [/spoiler]",55781,1180,76561198063531300,2,3.68 hrs

240720,Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy,12/6/2017,True,"When I was 17, I decided I wanted to be a game designer. I had previously toyed with the idea due to loving video games since I was a small small kid, but the pressures of highschool and having to decide what to do with your life finally made me solidify my decision and head towards the path of game development.

The years went by. I went to university for computer programming. It felt soulless and more concerned with teaching me how to manage databases for google rather than something fun and artistic with the skill. I decided to then go to art school, but realized I couldn't draw and that most of the classes were for people who knew what they were doing and just wanted to burn money practicing. And all the while, every time I tried to do something to advance myself personally aside from institutions, I would get shot down. Every year when I would finally muster up enough energy to attempt something creative to get better at the things I love, I would fail to meet my own high expectations and fail miserably. The failures hit me so hard I would never get back up until months and months would pass.

My friends felt like they were taunting me by trying to help me out. ""All you have to do is just keep doing things, and you'll get better at it"". The hardest part to swallow is that I knew it was true. But I didn't know how to explain the invisible force of failure to them. For some reason when they got back up from failing, they barely gave it any attention and just moved on to the next thing. Every time I attempted an ambitious project or failed to change something I wanted to do with my life, I would feel hopeless and like I could never come back from it. Even after the bitterness of defeat and depression wore off a few days later, a wave of long term procrastination would swathe over me for months and I would do nothing but waste my time living day to day and playing video games. It isn't that I suddenly didn't want to partake in these creative endeavours, but rather they just didn't get done- I would avoid them on a subconscious level by doing literally anything else just so I didnt have to feel the pang of self defeat and absolute misery. 

Then I played ""Getting Over It"". I bought it without any hesitation mainly because I am a huge fan of Sexy Hiking and wanted to play the spiritual sequel. The game drew me in immediately, there was that familiar damned tree at the very beginning, the way your hammer moved was exactly the same, and there were even some devious parts that I remembered coming exactly from the game itself. I moved my way up the mountain, and the commentary soothed me and provided me more information on Foddy's inspiration from sexy hiking and how he felt media was changing in recent years.

But the interesting thing was that I got back up. I would lose almost hours of progress, falling down the cliff in a way that was 100% crafted by Foddy to be devious and ""hateful"". But I took a deep breath, checked my phone, then got back to climbing the mountain. I would realize that once you fell down and regressed to a previous state of the game, due to your previous practice and new tactics you could get back up to where you were in half the time and frustration. I learned that recklessness is actually helpful in some situations, you can't hesitate and have to just ""do it"" rather than inch your way up slowly to get over some obstacles. 

At one point the commentary quoted Mary Pickford, saying ""Failure is not falling down, it is not getting up again"". that then made me realize what I was doing. Why was I approaching my life with fear and self hatred due to my failures and this stupid game with a dude in a bath pot was the one exception? I know that video games are fun and an escape from reality, but is climbing a virtual mountain designed to put stress and fatigue on the player really that less painful than having to fail on things in real life? I was learning recklessness, perserverance, self preservation, and self esteem- and immediately applying them to a sequel of a game called ""Sexy Hiking"" for gods sake.

Would I get to the top of the mountain? Maybe not. Maybe one failure would finally drive me over the edge, some terrible puzzle where you could easily hit the very bottom by making a simple mistake. But it was the fact that I gave it more of an honest and long term shot than most of my attempts at being creative that disturbed me. And I knew that after playing ""Getting Over It"", I would go back to my regular life, letting failures keep me down for months and retreating to my hundreds of video games instead of dealing with my anxiety and low self esteem. But while this realization may make me want to scream out for help in fear and panic, it also gives me hope that maybe this journey is not as hard as it seems. Maybe all it takes is a new perspective and new way of challenging yourself to make the oppressive force of falling down not so hard on yourself.

That doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.

This is not a proper FPS like the previous entries in the series, This is like Far Cry New Dawn with those ""RPG elements"", like enemy levels and shit.
Enemies are dumb but builletspongy and not fun at all to fight.

No pause cause this is supposed to be an online game. Sorry, but some of us have a life and have to pause the game while playing at home to do something else for a while. Understandable in COOP, unforgivable when playing alone (seriously, nobody on the dev team has kids?).

AI partner cannot be ordered around which is annoying. Really old games have had this feature (move there, attack that). No, she just walks around doing whatever she wants. Cannot even set weapon for her (would be awesome to complement me).

Story is as silly as ever, but now you get to choose between two girls to play who are twins, with exactly the same abilities but different hair. Wow.
Remember Dishonored  2 where you had two separate skillsets? Forget that, too much work for us! Replay value?  Nah, we make you return to the same locations again and again and respawn enemies  (this was not in the previous games). No  wonder this is the first not full price game in the series.

Also game stutters a lot, it has the same engine problems as the previous games.

546560,Half-Life: Alyx,3/23/2020,False,"DISCLAIMER: Not recommended **in its current state** for VR veterans looking for a fully immersive experience. The issues I will describe below are all fixable.

I played for slightly more than 3 hours in a row. So far, I like it, but it is not blowing my mind, and it has a lot of issues. I think this game is excellent for newcomers to VR, but will not satisfy people wanting a more complete and innovative experience like Boneworks or The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners.

Let me explain before you lash out at me.

Environments, graphics, and aosphere are amazing. Probably my favourite part of the game so far. The dialogue is a little bit too lighthearted at times (given the circumstances), but it is good as well.

My issues mostly stand with gameplay design decisions and lack of customization options.

The first thing I tried to do was smash a zombie on the head with a plank and then a metal tube. They just slid off of the zombie, causing no damage and reacting unrealistically. I found myself trying to punch headcrabs multiple times, doing absolutely zero damage. Not being able to use melee attacks was incredibly jarring and disorienting in a game that revolves around physics.

Smooth locomotion, which is the way I want to play, is also severely flawed. The walking speed is way too low. Please let me run away from threats. It just feels infuriating when Alyx is casually walking away from combines shooting at her instead of running. There have been situations where I wanted to sprint to cover, only to have Alyx slowly walk towards it. 

There is no jump mechanic at all. What we get is just a teleportation mechanic that is insultingly called a ""jump"", without any animation or restriction. In fact, I found myself abusing the ""jump"" mechanic to navigate long corridors because the walking speed was just too frustratingly low. There are some places in the game where you are forcibly teleported (e.g. going through a window).

Smooth turning (which is my preferred way to play) is also bugged: toggling the in-game option doesn't do anything. Also, when you fall from a height you just float like a feather. That is incredibly disorienting for me, and ruins my immersion.

Inventory management and weapon handling is also extremely flawed. First of all, I can store infinite full magazines in my backpack, but as soon as I shoot a bullet, I cannot put the magazine back in my backpack. This is, again, infuriating. Let me deal with the consequences of storing a non-full magazine, if I want to. I can also store infinite resin in the backpack, but not a single grenade! This is absolutely an immersion killer. The ""wrist slots"" are quite inconvenient to use during combat, especially the main hand one.

Boneworks and TWD:S&S have an holster system which works much much more nicely. TWD:S&S also has an incredibly well thought-out backpack mechanic where you can hold any items you want with limited space. It is just silly that Alyx can carry hundreds of bullets and resins but only two grenades.

Furthermore, you cannot drop your gun at all. It is attached to your hand, even if you're not gripping the controller. Other than being immersion breaking, this means that you cannot switch hand from right to left to fire from a left corner without exposing your entire body. It also means you cannot throw your gun as a last resort to stagger or kill an enemy and so on. Also, you can't obviously dual-wield. Not being able to let your gun go is puzzling, especially since this game was designed for the Knuckles.

Before you say ""but that would mean that people lose items behind by accident""... think again. Letting a gun go doesn't necessarily mean it needs to fall on the ground. It could be returned to your holster after a few seconds automatically in a non immersion-breaking way, via gravity gloves.

Weapons are selected through a menu. A menu! In a VR game! We've had plenty of releases showing how weapons can be stored in holsters attached to your body, or to your back. This is another immersion killer.

Finally, getting ammunition from your shoulder is very awkward. Most other games have a pouch either on the hip or the front which makes a lot more sense and is way more comfortable.

Another issue with the game is the insane amount of hand-holding and linearity. An invisible wall was blocking me from entering a dark area because I had no flashlight yet. Just let me go in if I want, and suffer the consequences! Invisible walls are the most immersion breaking thing, especially in VR. And no, some voice lines do not make it better. 

It also seems, so far, that most puzzles and levels have a single possible solution. E.g. grab the yellow keycard, find the blue keycard, and so on. It would have been more interesting if there were multiple ways to progress further, or optional areas with optional puzzles a la Boneworks. Hopefully this gets better further in.

This amount of hand-holding is also completely against the spirit of previous Half-Life games. Imagine an invisible wall stopping you from going to the test chamber in Half-Life 1 because you forgot to pick up a HEV Battery from Gordon's locker, and having a scientist telling you that ""maybe you forgot something in your locker"". Just let me deal with the consequences of my actions, and learn from them!

To recap, these are my main problems with the game:
* No melee attacks at all.
* Smooth locomotion is too slow.
* Smooth turning does not work.
* ""Jumping"" is just teleportation in disguise, and can be abused to go faster.
* Forced teleportation in many areas of the game.
* Inventory management makes no sense (no limits for certain objects, severe limits for others).
* Forced to discard non-full magazines.
* Getting ammunition from over the shoulder is awkward.
* No ammunition pouch on the hip or front of the body.
* Weapons are selected through a menu.
* No way to holster my guns on my body.
* I cannot let go of a weapon.
* I cannot use my non-dominant hand to hold a weapon.
* Very linear and ""hand-holding"" gameplay.

I understand completely that accessibility to VR newcomers was a priority for this game. However, that doesn't mean that customization options for more experienced players could have not been added. I am very disappointed in seeing that a forward-thinking company like Valve forgot about a sizeable chunk of their fan base who love hardcore and immersive experiences, like their previous Half-Life games.

Nevertheless, the game isn't ""bad"". It's just ""good"". At the moment, I would give it a 7/10. I cannot recommend it for veterans like me, however, so this is why the review is negative. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the future and I'll be able to recommend this game and update my review.


UPDATE: I played a few more hours, and the experience definitely hasn't improved. Graphics and aosphere are still top-notch, however the gameplay issues are becoming even more obvious. 

The smooth locomotion speed is just unacceptable for firefights. Combines were flanking me and I was only able to slowly walk away, resulting in a few deaths. Using the ""jump"" mechanic to take cover more quickly was almost a necessity in some of the shootouts, which took away from my immersion. 

The lack of a real ""jump"" is also starting to show its problems. There was a tripmine low on the ground, and I assumed I could just jump over it. Instead the ""jump"" mechanic went through the laser and resulted in a frustrating death.

I've also encountered a game-breaking bug right after the Nothern Star hotel. I do not know how, but my left hand completely disappeared. I went back and forth to see if it was stuck anywhere, but it wasn't. Then I gave up and reloaded a save file. Even after reloading and completely restarting the game, the save file was corrupted. My left hand was there, but it could not interact with anything. It could not grab objects, or even use gravity gloves.

546560,Half-Life: Alyx,3/23/2020,True,"About 3 hours in, I need to take a break. Here are my initial thoughts in easily-digestible point-by-point form:

[list]
[*]The game's tech outperformed even my pretty significant expectations. It's by far the best looking (and sounding) VR game I've played. Crucially, the [b]image quality is fantastic[/b], with absolutely no visible aliasing outside of very extreme cases of fine specular detail. And despite all that it maintains a pretty solid 144 (!!) FPS. Sure, I have a fast PC, but it's still a highly competent showing from the engine.
[*]The [b]grabbity gloves are an absolutely amazing mechanic[/b]. The first 2 times I tried to use them it was a bit awkward, and my reaction was a slightly disappointed ""hmm, that's it?"". The third time it felt better. The fourth time it felt absolutely amazing. And from that point on I just grabbed and threw stuff around everywhere without even thinking about it. This is an extremely polished mechanism of interaction.
[*]The attention to detail is great. From startling the cat from the first balcony, over the extremely cool looking puzzles to the interactions with NPCs, to the major scenes, all of it looks like it had a lot of care put into it.
[*]Even Valve doesn't have access to magic. While the physics are better (more stable and more conducive to smooth gameplay) than anything else I've played, it's still not too hard to make things explode.
[*]Headcrabs. [i]Fuck those.[/i]
[/list]

While I think that most people and reviews are not bringing up any valid points on why they dislike the game other than hopping on a ""fuc konami"" hatetrain, I tried to give MG Survive an unbiased try since I do highly respect the team behind the Metal Gear games and Survive deserves a chance.


I liked the idea of combining the MGS V gameplay with an open world survival game, especially because I absolutely loved the smooth controls of MGS V, but there is a lot wrong with Survive in my opinion.

You can't change the resolution or any graphic options until you are in the game... so you have to watch 20 minutes or realtime cutscenes on low settings and maybe even in a window before you can change the resolution... or you skip it, create a character, spawn in the tutorial, change your resolution and then RESTART THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN just to properly watch the cutscenes.
Only when I first have started a campaign and have a character at my disposal, it is possible to set the graphics in the main menu.

The borderless fullscreen is broken - yup, there is my taskbar... always watching me play. There is some helpful advice on how to ""fix"" this by changing stuff outside the game but I wonder why it works perfectly fine in any other game and MGSV.

This game does not go well with my monitor's refresh rate - I get screen tearing so bad, it like I'd have sandpaper as contact lenses - activating vsync gives a high delay

The story feels such a directionless mess, cringy as hell and it already has plotholes in the first minutes alone. Dialogue goes nowhere and gets interrupted by something completely unrelated just to have the story somehow proceed. Voiceactors sound unmotivated, they throw in some buzzwords to make it somehow interresting but sadly it just doesn't work for me, it feels poorly written and underdeveloped.


The combat is... meh - whenever I take that metal pipe and try to hit an enemy, my main character throws out 2 stiff animations in sequence that never change - this does not feel right, this feels like an early ARMA mod, the Machette does not feel any better, you unlock some combos later but they don't change the dynamics much. I had some other weapons later on such as a machette and a pistol but the stick was the most efficent way to tackle the creatures (and most unspectacular)

The building defense mechanisms on the fly during missions is a neat idea, it feels badly implement. You spawn a fence, zombies get stuck on it, you poke them with a stick until they are all dead and repeat the process with the next zombie waves.

The survival aspect is not very enjoyable. I went around and killed a herd of sheep and 2 rats - I ate 3 sheep steaks and my character is already hungry after what? 3 Minutes? You are also forced to drink dirty water until a certain chapter is unlocked - sadly until then, your character will be constantly vomit and this will drag on and on - while I do like this approach on having an unforgiving survival experience, it feels a bit tedious and on the nose, especially since later on the problem just disappears and you won't have to deal with dirty water anymore.

A curious bug I have encountered was, that movement refused to work after a menu interaction for no reason - happened two times after I exited a tutorial menu. I was unable to move anymore with my right analogue stick. I first thought my controler was fucked but NOPE, it works perfectly fine in the menu and on the map.


Overall, I am not feeling it. I dipped 3 hours into the game and I feel like nothing will change to the better or worse. I saw videos of amazing cutscenes from the game with massive boss battles but the overall gameplay does not chance. I would have given the game a better chance if it had a fully implemented 4-player coop as it was advertised back in 2016, but sadly, coop is just one gamemode restricted to one activity.",59323,2017,76561198001448000,55,3.02 hrs

285190,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III",3/3/2018,False,"What happened? 

The Imperial Knight world of Cyprus Ultima is under siege by the dreaded Ork hordes. The Imperial Inquisitor Holt has forbid Imperial forces from landing on the planet and assisting the besieged Knight hold. The Blood Ravens ignore the Inquisitor's orders and move to reinforce the- yadda yadda yadda.

Dawn of War III is like the poster child of corporate meddling. Everything that made the only Dawn of War games great is either gone or butchered to the point that its unrecognizable. This and Xcom: Declassified are two of the only games I never bothered to finish.

The game is some kind of weird amalgamation of Dawn of War and a really bad MOBA. You have the base building and the unit upkeep, but it feels so tact on that it becomes a chore to use. 
Its just so slow, all of the recruient and building feels like it takes forever compared to the older games. 
And that includes DOW 2. 

The A.I. Is also kind of...Slow, like special needs slow. 
For some reason, sometimes your army will just split up during movement and take different routes, even if they're all blobbed together. So I ended up having to micromanage where my soldiers were going basically at all times. 

The combat is lame. While older games had flashy colors and effects as well as neat melee animations, instead units now either just whack at one another until the other falls over, or shoot at one another until the other falls over. Sync kills are gone completely, taking away that sense of brutality that separated Dawn of War from basically every other RTS series. 
Dreadnoughts don't even pick dudes up and squish them anymore. They just whack them like the Orks are unruly children. 

Cover is also simplified to the point of uselessness. Around the map are these points that provide a shield bonus to your troops as long as they are in that area. They're so infrequent though that they basically only exist to annoy you and give you a reason to actually field melee units. 

I should probably say something nice about the game. 
Well the artwork for the cutscenes is really neat, and for some reason more violent than the actual game. Oh, and Deathwatch is actually in the game.
It's neat, they all have their own Chapter Insignia's on their pauldrons and everything. Its cool as hell, they didn't cop out on that.
So why did they cop out on everything else? 

Gabriel Angelos plays a big role in Dawn of War 3, but this time he's not voiced by Paul Dobson, who is basically THE Gabriel Angelos voice. (He also didn't voice Eliphas in Chaos Rising, which I thought was weird because he WAS in Chaos Rising as well but oh well.) 
Actually, now that I mention it, I don't think any voice actor makes a return. Gorgutz sounds completely different, the Dreadnought sounds like he's trying to spook me in a fake haunted house, and the Space Marines all sound like they don't want to be there.
I know Relic kept switching out voice actors from game to game, but this is a bit weak. Maybe it was because of the voice acting strike, and I'm usually for new talent. But with characters that fans can usually recognize by voice alone, its kind of a kick in the teeth.

By the time I'm writing this review, Dawn of War III has essentially been thrown away by Relic. All future DLC or expansion packs have been put in the fire due to poor sales. The game is abandonware.
Not like many people are even playing it, I couldn't even find a game when I tried to play multiplayer. Though that could be because of connection issues. 

During development, Relic tried to go for the ‚Äúnew audience approach.‚Äù 
As in they wanted the MOBA audience. But people who were going to buy Dawn of War III weren't going to buy it for a MOBA, and the people who play MOBAs already have a MOBA of choice that doesn't cost them 60 dollars. 
To put that into consideration for you, the game didn't even launch with Annihilation mode. The basic mode that was in every Dawn of War game before this one. 
They removed Deathmatch from Unreal Tournament. 

After the backlash Dawn of War III received, they seemed to panic and started pandering to the RTS crowed again. But the game was obviously already built for a more casual, MOBA style approach. So all of the actual RTS elements that people buy the games for are tact on and pretty basic. 
Relic thought they could salvage it and get the attention of both crowds with this. But I would like to eat food that wasn't cooked over a dumpster fire, we can't have everything we want now, can we. 

I'm sure a lot of higher up meddling was involved, there had to have been. There's no way that veterans of Relic's caliber would willingly do something as ignorant and asinine as this. 

Dawn of War III isn't a Dawn of War game. It doesn't have the classic gameplay of Dawn of War I, and it doesn't have the tactical unit management of Dawn of War II.
Do yourself a favor and just pick up one of those games, they're cheaper and much, much, MUCH more worth your time. 
The way Dawn of War III plays is like a very ,very bad version of Starcraft. But I can't even say that because Starcraft does what it does excellently. It threw away its core audience in favor of an audience that doesn't exist. And now it doesn't have an audience at all. 

Dawn of War III gets a train wreck out of 10.

There isn't much content beyond ""run out and collect resources and recipies"". The grind wouldn't even be that bad if the combat was fun, however instead it's as simple as hammer the left mouse button while you hide behind a fence, and once the fence breaks climb up onto a cliff and crouch down to stab them in the head so they can't reach you and do anything. Co-op would be ok, if it wasn't for the prior complaints, I like the idea of playing with my friends to fend off a horde, but once again, it isn't enjoyable with the combat presented in the game.

It's a shame, because I did want to like this game, I wanted to see how Konami would handle Post-Kojima Metal Gear. I can now see though that this is going to be a dark era for the Metal Gear series, if it even makes it past this mess.",7458,1239,76561198063458800,13,2.57 hrs

- great graphics and it runs well
- interesting team base modes
- great environments
- there is a learning curve which is not a bad thing.  As your skill grows, so do the possibilities.
- overall, its pretty fun

Con's:
- Sorry folks, the negative reviews to do with connection issues are real.  Frequent drops, connection errors, maddening lag that always hits at the worst time.  Dropping from games though is not excusable.
- Game play is a bit repetitive, but to offset that is tremendous oppurtunity to customize and level your character.  Also, multiplayer is where it is at, but then you run into the connection issues.

355790,Styx: Shards of Darkness,6/18/2017,True,"Styx is a rare breed for stealth games, it offers a challenge in a genre that has dumbed down for the mainstream. From Thief to Metal Gear Solid, third-person stealth games have become less challenging to cater to everyone, and the AI has decreased in quality. 

Along comes Styx, a fantasy stealth adventure that offers a challenge. You will find no scripted events, boring tailgating missions or magic concealment bushes here. The enemy detection and AI in this game are excellent, guards will search and scour an area if they detect the slightest sound or see a figure lurking in the shadows. The stealth AI reminds me of the early Metal Gear Solid titles where you must use the environment to conceal yourself, hiding bodies and extinguishing sources of light as you sneak. 

The parkour requires timing and precision, people writing negative reviews are used to the Assassin's Creed style of parkour which offers no real challenge except the press of a simple button.

There are weaker parts of Styx, the voice acting and sound can leave something to desire but this is to be expected from a smaller low budget title. Ubisoft and other big budget developers could learn from Styx. Overall, Styx is not a game of the year production but if you are looking for a challenging and stealth adventure reminiscent of stealth games from the past, you can't go wrong with Styx: Shards of Darkness.",88775,1197,76561198101280400,6,2.47 hrs

Imagine you have a cake. It's pink and white and layered with strawberries so you kind of already know what to expect. Sure, there are some hints of chocolate icing here and there that suggests there might be a little bit more to it, but overall it seems quite simple. 
And sure enough it is. You take a bite here, and another forkfull there, and all you can taste is the sweetness of the strawberry and the light fluffiness of the cream. The chocolate icing makes its way onto your tongue every now and then, but it's all within the realms of expectations. You decide to push forward a little more, dig in a little deeper.
But something's wrong, and you sure did not anticipate this. Thick caramel sauce starts oozing out from the centre, dragging little chunks of honeycomb with it. You realise that the strawberry and vanilla cream you've been tasting all this time has been but a pretense for what it really hid inside. You try to soak up the caramel with the outer layer of the cake, but it's no use; eventually the caramel drenches everything into mushy, sticky mess. And boy, is it glorious.

My brothers last dying wish, to play 3 Kingdoms
Three Kingdoms
I‚Äôve sent email, reached out to influencers I know, and am using social media to try and get this done.

My little brother was diagnosed with leukemia late last year. He was winning the battle, and just last week we were getting ready for him to have a bone marrow transfusion. Unfortunately this past weekend, the cancer came back with a vengeance, and doctors don‚Äôt think he will last long.

One of his wishes/goals is to play Total War: Three Kingdoms before he dies. With the doctors not thinking he will survive long, the 24th release date may be to late.

Can anyone help me get this to the developers/publishers to see this post?

Edit 1: For anyone in doubt, I understand why you would feel this way. Here is a link of him currently in the ICU http://imgur.com/dBWKd3X

Edit 2: OMG, u/DogbertCA on here and Grace on twitter have made one kid extremely happy. When I told him the good news, he cried, and couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening. When I told him who sent it, he was so shocked. I then immediately got kicked out of the room to go home and download it since the internet at the hospital sucks. I should be back there in a hour and he cant wait to play!

He wants to say his thanks to all of you for your support, it means a lot. And from me, I don‚Äôt know much about this game, just hear him always talking about it. To see the outpouring of support from all of you is truly touching. It means a ton to me and my family, thank you, thank you, thank you!

Edit 3: The response from all of you is incredible. The second I got back to his room he was ready to get playing, and was so excited by the intro and being able to play. Not sure what I can and can‚Äôt post so I took a picture of him at the logo screen and one of us. He taught me what we had to do, and we won the first battle (thanks to him)! You guys are all amazing! I will myself purchase the game when it comes out, so that I‚Äôll be able to cherish this moment forever. Also I will be printing out all of your comments for him. I read some to him and the smiles and laughs he got was tremendous. So again, thank you, all of you!

A couple people have asked, I won't give our exact location, but we're in Tampa, FL. Watching the intro video he was amazed and out gorgeous it was. He went in to detail telling me about the different people we could choose from, etc. It was a student trains teacher moment. I promise I will reply to each and everyone of you, and this thread will always be something I come to!

377160,Fallout 4,11/10/2015,False,"I enjoyed F3 and FNV but this is just terrible.

1) F4 ditched *having an RPG system* and replaced it with stock linear-perk Action game. Alpha Protocol has deeper systems than this, honestly. I might as well be playing COD: Wasteland with a quest system.

2) The world design is just lazy. You know how in F3 and FNV there were neat little things hiding behind every nook and cranny? Every inch of the map told a fun story, and each little shack and camp had an ""implicit tale"" that was told by the world design. Some were silly, some were funny, some were sad, some where disturbing. Skeletons in bathtubs with a shotgun positioned on their head and blood splatter on the wall, and if you dig around you can find a little note. But not so with F4! It's just generic terrain as far as the eye can see with the occassional loot pickup. Go back to F3 and you see bottlecaps positioned on tables as if someone lived there. In F4 it's all about streamlining the loot drops (bottle cap stash? c'mon). Who made the decision that the performance/visual gain from reducing the number of interactable world objects was the right trade? In an open world RPG? Next-gen graphics is not why people play RPGs! As I said, we're dealling with COD:Wasteland here.

3) Yeah I get it you designed the UI for console. Guess what. I play on a PC and I miss the previous dialog system. And I know this sounds nit-picky, but how much of the budget went into VO? I don't care about VO... in fact I find it incredibly distracting because I like to give my character the voice in my head, not the voice of the actor you hired. <engage Fat Comic Book Guy> Earth to Bethesda, you are not making a movie.

4)The great thing about the dialog systems from F1,F2,F3,FNV was that you could see what your character was going to say before you said it. You were rewarded for paying attention to the NPC's mood, and the subtle cues from his/her text. This ME ripoff is simply not suited for a Fallout game since the point of playing a character in a story-rich RPG is having control over what he says!

I'm the sort of player that has like 100s of hours into pretty much every open world RPG I touch, and that includes multiple Bethesda Titles (F3,Skyrim,Oblivion,etc). This is game is not going to be one of them. I will be requesting a refund.

EDIT:

I want to clarify what I meant by ""lazy world building.""

in both FNV and F3, even in the new player areas, it felt like I couldn't go behind a hill without ""finding a location"" that had basically a mini-vignette. And it's not just about skeletons in death poses, it's the feeling that somebody used to occupy this space, and it's really just a lot of little touches and attention to detail. In F3 and NV the world was just filled with random little details (if you pay attention) and plus maps were HUGE. You could tell a well-staffed experienced team spent a lot of time world building. It's like for every shack and gas station they asked ""who lived here? what was he doing?""

This is what it means for *me* to be immersed in an RPG -- the suspension of disbelef that the world exists with or without me, and I'm just passing through.

I found F4 totally lacked this. And yeah, it's a feeling thing... but so is ""fun"" and everything else important to game aesthetics. I want feel like a location is a legiate place in the game world that I ""happen"" to run across, rather than solely existing to supply me with loot for the next scripted battle. I felt F4 was mostly the latter.

Maybe other players don't care about these sorts of little touches, but for me when I play an RPG it really matters to my immersion in the world. Otherwise I just see right through to the treadmill skinner box and I might as well be playing an FPS/shooter.

Which brings me back to my main contention is that F4 isn't an RPG game. F3 is, NV is, but F4 isn't. If Bethesda wanted to make an FPS fine, but that is not how the game was advertised and honestly it's a huge waste of the Fallout license which is primarily an RPG franchize. In a larger sense this is a very disturbing trend I see in the industry... a large company buys a beloved RPG franchize, and makes a shooter out of it and burns the core franchize fans because cashgrab. Then buy a new franchize, rinse/repeat. It's parasitic behavior.",91013,1010,76561198002305800,6,2.20 hrs

252490,Rust,1/1/2014,False,"Rust definitely has potential to be a good survival game,and in some aspects it already is. However, most of these good parts are countered by gamebreaking flaws in game design or massive issues caused by the community.
I cannot recommend it at this stage because of the glaring problems that lie in the core structure and the Developers mentality. Even ""it's an alpha"" can't excuse some of the awful design decisions made by the developers,especially when it comes to core aspects of the game like Server administration and Balancing.

This review is mostly focused on the negatives because there's plenty of rose-tinted reviews upvoted on the store page anyways if you're just looking for something to convince you to buy it, so here's the most gamebreaking problems in it's current stage:

- The big One: Server administration! The developers decided to give all the power to the people who are willing to pay for hosting Servers. Server administrators have a cheat console. In a game based on survival. Yep. They have Godmode(!!!) on command, can teleport any- and everyone where they please, spawn in items for themselves or others, change server Rules on the fly without anyone ingame noticing,wipe the entire server and reset everyone's progress to zero, ban/kick anyone they wish without having to give reasons...the list goes on and will probably expand if the developers decide to keep this ""feature"". Some people think this is a good thing.  The notion of admins flying around in godmode without taking damage from anything,spawning in explosives to destroy bases and kicking people just because they killed one of the admins or something ridiculous seems entirely fine to some people because they think of the game like Garrys Mod. And those are the same people whose recommendations based on an hour of gameplay you see upvoted on the Store Page.

And if you think ""surely admins won't abuse that power and it can be used for good only because admins are good people"", you couldn't be more wrong. Giving admins a cheat console is ASKING for abuse. And don't get me wrong, there neeeds to be administration,someone to kick hackers and griefers (which there are plenty of,see below) but you cannot give anyone who decides to pay for server hosting a cheat console and expect them to only use it for those things. 
Dedicated servers hosted by the game are scarce and fully populated and don't have proper administration, so griefers can flourish for days without ever getting banned. 
And the solution is so simple: DON'T give admins a cheat console. Give them the tools to get rid of hackers and griefers, and give those tools to the community too. Votekick! An option to report players. An option to atleast SEE which admins are currently on,and what the names of server admins are, and an option to report those admins if they are abusing their power,which happens all the time on many servers. All of this is currently missing, and it can easily break your experience of the game.

-Server-bound progression: Everything you do in the game is bound to one server only,the server you are currently on.Now this sounds like it would be good at first,and yes,it is necessary to keep the balance and avoid serverhopping. But couple this with the cheat console admins and think about it. You might play for hours building up a base and then discover that all of it gets blown up by an admin with godmode on who decides to spawn in explosives and destroy all your stuff because he feels like it. Anything you do ingame is in the hands of the admins of the server you play on,and that is a huge issue which many people don't seem to realize until they experienced it themselves.
This would not be an issue if admins wouldn't have as much power as they currently have (and if hackers wouldn't exist) or if there were dedicated,modded servers with websites,active admins and features like votekicking or an actual working Banning/kicking software other than Steams VAC-banning which often takes several months to be processed and even then only bans the current account, not the IP. I don't doubt that those servers will start to form once the community has access to or developed new tools, but right now every server you join is a gamble, you might play for hours and get all of it destroyed by a power-abusing admin or hacker.

-The big issues caused by the community: Killing on Sight (KoS), Griefing, Hacking,abusing admin Powers, regular DDoS-attacks, Killing freshspawns, camping spawnpoints, VoiP without mute feature (enjoy your 12year olds squeaking or teens trying to be bandits), the list goes on.: This obviously depends on your personality and if you care or don't care,but even if you don't care you WILL see it,and quite often,and won't be able to ignore it. Rust has no age restrictions, is quite cheap, has similarities to Minecraft and DayZ,and is hyped just as much because...well,it's a survival game and we all want a good one. So enjoy your hordes of wannabe bandits, squeaking pewdiepie fans and teenage godmode admins wrecking your base because you didn't comply with their wannabe bandit demands. Hacking is common, abusing admin powers is essentially the same and happening all the time. Killing on Sight seems to be standard because that's the trend that DayZs banditry hype sadly set. Camping spawwnpoints and shooting fresh spawns happens all the time because some kids just need to stroke their epeen on a daily basis by shooting unarmed freshspawns or people with far inferiour gear.

- Balancing: People who have played on a server for quite some time will have all the best gear you can get. Kevlar-clad players with Holo-scope silenced M4s with laser sight and flashlight who are able to instantly heal themself up with large medkits at the press of a button are the sort of thing you'll inevitably face,naked or in cloth armor that barely protects you,with your rock or hatchet or maybe even 9mm Pistol if you managed to set up a shack before you got oneshot randomly for no apparent reason. The combat system is barebones, most weapons oneshot or kill a fresh spawn in about 2 seconds flat while kevlar armor seems to absorb Pistol bullets like a spongue, not to mention how much easier it is to hit someone with holo sights and laser designation. The blueprinting system seems fun at first and adds a layer of progression into the game but once you encountered a fully geared out person you'll see the issues with it: to even stand a chance of winning versus someone who has played on a server for a long time and has a base with tons of supplies somewhere you will need dozens of hours of gathering,crafting and farming zombies and ""radtowns"" for blueprints and a good bit of luck paired with the constant danger of getting oneshot or your base raided by snowballing fully geared ""veterans"". On high populated servers your base will inevitably get raided quickly before you can even build enough defenses to stand a chance, and the people who already played a long time on the server will simply be able to break through anything with c4 anyways. 



Theres plenty more issues with the game but those are the most potent gamebreaking ones you should know about. A lot of people don't know about these issues because they haven't encountered them yet or ignore them because of the hypetrain, and ""it's an alpha"" seems to be an excuse for bad design choices and massive core structure flaws nowadays, so I'll leave it at that.
 Rust undoubtedly has positive aspects and I've had my fun building stuff with others, but until they decide to strip admins of their ridiculous godmode powers or dedicated servers with policing are established I simply cannot recommend it to you. I want a good survival game as much as everyone else but unfortunately Rust isn't it,at least not in the current state.
